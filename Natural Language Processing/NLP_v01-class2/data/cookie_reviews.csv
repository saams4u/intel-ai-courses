A368Z46FIKHSEZ,5,I love these cookies!  Not only are they healthy but they taste great and are so soft!  I will definitely add these to my grocery list!
A1JAPP1CXRG57A,5,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:<br /><br />--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I'd had a relatively ""healthy"" start to the day.<br /><br />--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.<br /><br />--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!"
A2Z9JNXPIEL2B9,5,"I am usually not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these literally melt in your mouth. They are so soft and tasty! I would definitely recommend these to someone who loves oatmeal, and even those like me who would probably pick a different flavor over this one."
A31CYJQO3FL586,5,"I participated in a product review that included a sample of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH8M"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.  Okay first of all I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies and this one was no exception.  It was great!!! Soft n chewy, nice portion size and and as always a high quality product from Quaker Oats.  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster to for including this in their Mom Voxbox.  If you haven't tried it you need to and make sure to share it with the family."
A2KXQ2EKFF3K2G,5,"My kids loved these. I was very pleased to give my kids a quick on the go healthy snack before soccer and acne practice. They loved the flavor, I loved that its healthy."
A2U5TAIAQ675BL,5,I really enjoyed these individually wrapped big oatmeal cookies. They are really soft and chewy. You can buy different flavors. I will definately be repurchasing these cookies in the future. They are delicious and super healthy too.
A1R4PIBZBD3NZ0,4,"I was surprised at how soft the cookie was. I usually buy Little Debbie's cookies, and I noticed the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was bigger and had a bold taste."
A1ECQ8LJMXG4WI,5,Filled with oats and raisins you'll love this snack ..... Delicious and nutritious ..... what else is there to say.... you can't beat that....
A3MSG4E5MLI1XP,5,"I was recently given a complimentary ""vox box"" from influenster, call the mom vox box. It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie ""raisins"" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets"
A3BUDUV9GORLWH,5,"the best and freshest cookie that comes in a package, we ate them up, wishing we had more. soo good"
A3HW0FYDWOUP3D,5,I am a huge fan of the Quaker Chewy cookies! The moist cookies are satisfying and not too sweet. The high quality ingredients are a crowd pleaser. A must have for any car trip! After one cookie I was hooked. Highly recommend!
A2AH0NQIVXE3HL,5,yummy and delicious. i love eating it when it when its warm. the best store bought cookies! cant wait to buy more!
A2ZGYBGUC2O3DG,5,"I received a Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie to try/eat for free from Influenster [...]). I shared the cookie with my kids, and we gobbled up the cookie faster than you can say ""Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookies."" It was soft (as advertised) and included a sufficient amount of raisins to make me happy (I like raisins). It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)"
A1SYBOB4WOOTTO,5,These cookies were so good. Can't wait to go out and buy some more! A good snack when you don't want to over-indulge yourself
A3DJKYKNPY6VD5,5,I received these in my MomVox box from influenster! I loved it! Oatmeal cookies are my favorite and these are by far the best store bought brand I have tasted! I recommend these to anyone with a sweet tooth trying to stay healthy.
A35R5NGXV8YXJC,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies taste just like the cookies my grandma used to bake. Great to take as a quick breakfast since it is made with whole grain Quaker Oats.
A1SXVTJXIYPKF5,5,"These cookies are a real hit with my children! I received a sample from @Influenster in my Mom Vox Box. I enjoyed the sweetness, yet whole grain taste (which I love) and the moist raisins. This cookie would be perfect for breakfast, snack, or dessert! What could be better than that?! I love these cookies and definitely will be buying more!"
AM3E6SVW2M0X3,4,I really enjoy Quaker's products and the fact that they are more healthy than most other products. These were really good especially if you like raisins.
A3MCMVDYBTDFJ3,5,This was the most delightful cookie i ever tasted. I was very surprised on how soft and fresh it tasted. It makes a great snack on the go as well! I tried the chocolate almond as well and YUMMY! Quaker hit  this one out of the park!
A1KNO1B2QQL16M,4,"Quaker used some good ingredients in the cookie and one cookie eaten amongst four kids did not meet the nutritional panel for one cookie. Even if one cookie was eaten by them each the nutritional panel was pretty good.  So, I can be a happy mom about the children eating the cookie"
A3PM5X6Z3B36K,5,"My daughter stole it from me and ate it, I guess it's a good thing I can't stand oatmeal.  But both my kids are already huge fans of all things Quaker so it's easy for me to write this review.<br /><br />Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are chewy, nutrition and according to my kids, DELICIOUS.  They are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats, individually packaged at $2.69 for a box of 6, is a good source of fiber, only contains 6 grams of total fat per cookie and sold pretty much EVERYWHERE!"
A2GLT67QUPVQSF,5,"I loved this delicious cookie! I even shared it with my 11 month old, and I'm a pretty big health nut when it comes to what I feed my daughter. It tasted great, was a great portion and it's not full of fats and sugars like all of those other cookies!"
A1VS92UYKY0GHN,5,I enjoy these cookies... They taste like my grandmas homeade cookies.. Plump and super soft!!! I can't wait to try the other favors made by quacker.l
A1HI90UH876FKB,5,"These cookies have perfect flavor, excellent moist/dry combination and are very soft. They melt in your mouth. I love the taste, I could eat box after box!"
A5H2KQ06DLGWW,5,"Received this through VoxBox and loved it. My son ended up with most of it, which is fine. Excellent product to keep on hand or in the diaper bag."
A184ZFZZBWEXMS,5,"I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade ""vanishing oatmeal"" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie."
A1JE9RKJSQ9WGO,5,I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful.
A35MLIRKBT4BYA,5,"I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these oatmeal cookies, they were delicious. It is a great go to snack when you are out and about and need something quick... and the kids love them!"
A3GJEEX2OZB1C4,5,"This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins"
A2PMWI7ZJ0AU2N,5,"I received a free sample of these cookies through Influenster and immediately got hooked on them. They're are so soft, perfect for anytime but specially for breakfast. My son loved them even though he doesn't like Oatmeal. I had to purchase more and now we treat ourselves every morning to a yummy cookie."
A2RF55IVDK96SD,5,"I loved the texture, the natural taste, and the softness was just right!!! If you are wanting a good cookie to take o the go, or for anytime, this is a very good choice!!"
A2WSAGFJSQC1YF,4,"First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar."
A2GSJUETASGMO0,5,"These are nice soft, spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor.  They are a perfect single serving size, in a perfect individual wrap.  They have a good taste, natural, not artificial and are a satisfying snack.  I would buy these to take for a snack or lunch."
A1S78V0MOUYFUA,4,"Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.  Not like homemade but very good for store bought."
A1RXO6AXR1ROQB,4,"i was surprised i liked it! i normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were sooo soft and chewy. it was delicious. i shared one with my daughter and she wolfed it down!"
A2V0H5HIN4OWKN,2,"Oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite but I do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie.  The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but 170 for one cookie sure isn't diet food.<br /><br />2 stars."
A3IFHZYZT1SY5G,5,"WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, ""Mommy, can I have more?"" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies. I was very impressed with the packaging and how SOFT the cookies really were when you opened them and the flavor that they had. Very Impressive. Would definitely buy!"
A10E3F50DIUJEE,4,"Quaker products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.<br /><br />There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at: 170 calories, 6g of fat, 27g carbohydrates, 4 g dietary fiber, 12g sugar, and 2g protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.<br /><br />For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, Quaker's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!"
A3E7903YPPDO7,5,This is more than just a cookie. It is a guilty pleasure. Except that you dont have to feel guilty because it is good for you. It is so soft and fresh you would think your grandma just baked it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!
A1C66LMRGMGV19,5,"I received a sample pack of the Raisin variety of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster to test out with my family.<br /><br />My 22 month old son loved the cookie and almost ate the whole thing himself. I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!"
A154QSI0I9S28O,5,The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them.
A2JU7J2OMXGUGV,5,"My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy."
A1CFU5XJXN3PV4,4,"Quaker, which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness."
A1AFEJ0230S741,5,"After trying these cookies for the first time, i am hooked and dont feel guilty because they are delicious. Thanks Quaker for another awesome product."
APPCJX62WKIIP,3,"In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But ""healthier"" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K"">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging."
A1QZVTFM26YGQF,5,"I received 1 to try out and wasn't to sure what to expect. they are delicious i have to say, will definatly be buying more"
A3APJ36C9R1XBZ,5,Love these cookies my Son asks me to heat one for him in the microwave for about 15 sec its soooo good that way gives it the freshly baked feel...I always make sure to keep in stock in my home...they are also individually packed do makes it easy to carry along in my bag
AJUQOZM0WFP4J,5,These cookies are so soft and tasty. I love the texture of the cookie!! I will definitely be eating these cookies as a snack for lunch.
A1FVP6G8W3O8ZA,2,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something."
AJ6AFRHY0TE85,5,"TOTALLY DIFFERENT!<br />chewy, soft-baked cookie, Healthier alternative,<br />Individually packaged / Good for on the go!<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Great Healthier snack for all the family!<br /><br />I don't like oatmeal & raisins... but this cookie really taste great! :D"
A26XA5ME599Q8X,5,It is nice to have a cookie that my kids enjoy and I don't have to worry about it being unhealthy. I was very happy to receive this in my Influenster Mom Voxbox!
AXOHUES3YZ4UG,5,I was very surprised how soft they were. I gave one to my kids and they loved them. Definitely getting more for them!
AM25R904WN2HA,4,"These are great on the go treats for adults, and the kids too - if you wanna share ;)<br />They're bursting with flavor and nutritious to boot."
AW5HYD1A2DUCJ,5,totally my kids favorite cookie so good soft not so much sweet exactly one that i want to give my kid
A2YVU7PKI7069M,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are now my favorite cookies.  They are so soft and delicious.  And I love how they come individually wrapped so I don't have to worry about the rest of them going stale.<br />I definitely recommend giving these cookies a try - you'll be glad you did!
AK0PXM8POPVMO,5,"I got a sample of these from Influenster, and I went out and bought more right away.  These are the softest and tastiest packaged cookies I've had.  I love the flavor, Oatmeal Raisin cookies are my favorite.  Even though they are cookies, I feel like I could be doing a lot worse health-wise than these."
A1YC8ZO2WFMGYQ,4,"I received a sample package of this product complimentary from [...]  to try. I must say, it was super yummy. The cookies are large enough to satisfy my sweet tooth yet small enough that i didn't feel like I was gorging myself either. Best part is, they are healthy enough that i don't mind feeding them to my kiddos as a special treat."
A11DV7U73MFGMY,5,"Love the soft baked cookies, tastes great and I don't feel guilty eating this cookie. They are also individually wrapped so it's great for throwing in a bag for hiking or in kid's lunch. I tried the oatmeal raisin and must say it's my favorite, apparently many others favorites as I can never found them on the shelves."
A357D8AWVFNNH6,5,I got the influenster box and it had several products in it.  My kids loved the quaker soft bake cookie.  would get some if I were you
A1B97O8MZHDNYB,5,Cookie was so soft and my son acutally loved it and he really doesnt like a lot of item. I really love this cookie and i did purchase again.
A17RQPA1VCKTYM,5,my kids and i enjoyed the Quaker Soft Baked cookies.  they are great for lunch boxes and for snacks at home or on the go.  i loved the soft baked texture and fresh taste.
ADR3MR8529NOD,5,This is a great tasting cookie.  Portion size is close to perfect.  Soft texture with almost homemade flavor.  What a find?!?! I love these cookies!
A2S41GL7XNIYH5,4,Quaker always surprises me with all their wonderful products which are satisfying for the whole family. I really love these Oatmeal soft baked cookies!! They are made from whole grain quaker oats and have a wonderful flavor! I can't wait to buy more of these and other yummy products!
A10L198Q8ZKC0H,5,"I really enjoyed these cookies. They tasted fresh & homemade and very soft and chewy.....I will purchase again, definitely a favorite!"
A3JLHTAO1HD8RT,5,"I just love the oatmeal raisein cookie it was super soft and delicious, i was amazed by the amount of raisens in it because there usually isnt enough in other brands. Not only did i love this cookie but my daughter loved it so much i had to go out and buy a box of them. Id def. reccomend these to any cookie lover, im a fan for life."
A1AT4YHGX2QVWS,5,"These are so yummy. They taste just like my grandmas homestyle cookies. They are a perfect texture, just enough sweetness, and leave you craving for more! I can't get enough of them. I eat them with a nice glass of cold milk and it's heaven!"
AU4U0ISJ875XL,4,These are really good.  I love raisin cookies and this one did not dissapoint me.  It is soft and they are in individual packs.  I got it free from Influenster to try and liked it.
A29SZ6ZTP4MH9H,2,These cookies would be better if they were made with rolled oats instead of oat flour. The crumbly and mealy texture does not provide an enjoyable experience.
A2FBKA2838KO0C,4,"This cookie is full of flavor and at a great price.  I got a sample free in the mail, and will be buying more for my son!  We both loved them."
A3V980JQPFQVDJ,5,This cookie was moist chewy and delicious.  Both my daughter and I thought it was fabulous and I will definitely buy in the future.
A32ZZQV7FBYBBK,4,"This is pretty good for a store bought cookie! It was nice and soft, not too sweet. Just right. I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars because I like my cookies a little chewy. Overall great cookie! I got one of these cookies as a sample from @influenster."
A1TIALU0XG3172,5,This cookie was really good... I liked the single serve packaging and the portability of the product! great for on the go and not loaded with junk!
AHG9NC2C0FN98,5,I am very impressed with the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They are a healthier cookie and have a great taste. Very soft and melt in your mouth.
A1CKSRF05IVVHW,3,"It's not too sweet so I like that. The kids love it and let's face it, cookies are generally not healthy, so this is ok, not the healthiest, but good!"
AO8W9PQE5UYGA,4,"These cookies are delicious, a little messy but have a great taste, my kids also enjoyed them, it is a lunch bag must have."
A3VR7QSYW1VUR9,4,These are so soft and really yummy. I like that I can grab a pouch and toss it in my purse for an afternoon snack.
AXLPWBWM7IO0G,5,"I'm not a lover of oatmeal raisin cookies, but this one surprised me! I loved how soft and flavorful it was. YUM. I highly recommend. I got these as a sample from Influensters!"
A3KPHXGQ2SUVCG,4,I love these. They taste great and they are easy to throw in your bag and bring a long with you for a snack for yourself or a child. My 3 year old liked the taste as well. I do think they are a bit pricey but they are full of whole grains which is better than normal cookies.
A1HDZG1VI59BFY,5,"My son and I both LOVED these cookies, very yummy and delicious.  My son ate them so quickly that I hardly got any LOL.  I really like the texture of the cookies, and they are quite filling."
A2XTQ37EZJP90N,5,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster, and it was a big hit.  Soft, chewy, and tasty.  Only thing I would change about it is that it doesn't travel very well because it gets too crumbly."
A28SGC3ISWHB9E,5,"The Quaker Oatmeal Raisin cookies could not be more delicious! They have that homemade taste w/out all the mess!! I was surprised at how soft they were and you could really taste cinnamon and other flavors, they did not taste processed.  The most important thing- my kids loved them too!"
A3U57Z3U2OZ00,4,"I got to try these through Influenster. Though I'd planned to buy my own, I'm glad I had to do it for the site, because otherwise I wouldn't have tried the Oatmeal Raisin. I'm not a fan of the combo. I don't know why.<br />But, Quaker did a great job. There was the perfect combination of oatmeal to raisin, and I didn't feel like I was tasting cardboard, as I tend to with oatmeal cookies. Instead, it was super moist, and honestly, if it had been hot, I would have assumed it was straight from the oven. Just perfectly done!"
A2K4ZSJPDAQCG1,5,warm these up and they taste like you just pulled them out of the oven ... love love love these. My kids also really really enjoyed these .... my 5 year old thought they were home made !
A261GIK3PL0UFF,4,These cookies are not only yummy but they are good for you. My children love them too. Its a great snack for them and I don't feel guilty giving it to them. Try one!!
A1BAK2PJSVK8MX,4,"I do not like Oatmeal raisin cookies, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the soft texture and the taste of these cookies. I would recommend these if you love oatmeal raisin cookies."
A1KVYM5CNK75PR,5,I was pleasantly surprised with this cookie. It has a great flavor and was nice and moist! My three year old daughter loved it also!
A3I4Z02JQ4VZ29,4,"This cookie was very good, but a little dry for my taste! I would also prefer it to taste more like a homemade cookie with more raisins."
A2OI26HDSEZFEB,5,It's amazing!  Love the taste and texture!! awesome price!! My 3 year old loved it and she is a HARD SELL!!
A2R3C0OG2HFQ9H,5,Great taste and packaging. Perfect for lunch boxes and take along snacks. We have enjoyed these cookies and look forward to more flavors.
AAPPWNP9FWVWS,3,"Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."
A3FHDBBXZFNQUK,3,"These cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and I think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  The cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste."
A2Q53HT28RCH8N,4,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was given to me to sample through Influenster Mom Vox box program.  It tasted like it was home baked.  I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my 14 year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too."
A24O0OS2H86QV,5,Quaker Cookies for me is that one in the package is suffice for me with a cup of tea or hot cocoa. Usually I go digging for a few more cookies to conquer my sweet tooth but not this time.
A1QZQ1UC11S7SU,5,"This is a really good cookie! DIdnt really think that I would like a cookie from a company known for its oatmeal, but completely surprised!! It was soft and soooo chewy! Really good served warm & with a cold glass of milk!"
A2FH1KKTJCP5QW,5,"I tried this cookie (which came free in my Mom Vox Box 2012) and I fell in love with it! My kids and my husband liked it, too! It is soft and chewy with a delicious home-baked taste. We will definitely include this in our stash of healthy goodies & snacks!"
A2K14OQTVABTMY,5,I wasn't sure if I was gonna like these until I received a free sample and fell in love with it. These cookies are so soft and yummy. My 5 year old loved it. Can't get enough of it.
A31OLWW8C0GJXW,5,"I originally purchased these cookies at the store and then being an influenster I received a sample of the Oatmeal Raisin Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. These make a great snack for kids and adults alike. These are great to carry in a diaper bag for that lil pick me up when out and about. They have so many flavors and styles of there new soft baked. They are soft but not crumbly, easy to eat not to chewy, they are filling and satsfying."
A2KX939MKLWD64,3,"I'm not a fan of oatmeal or raisins (lol) but I wanted to taste the cookie before I gave it to my daughter. So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.<br /><br />**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  But if I had to grade this with the price that Amazon has it for, I would probably give it 1 star!  A 6-pack of these cookies is $2.69 so why is a 12-pack almost $35 on here?! Am I missing something, lol**"
A1Z65IGMZ9SR7D,4,These soft cookies are very tasty and have a great texture. They are just the right size for an afternoon snack.
A2MMB9EG82GAT8,3,"I have only tried Quaker Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were not my favorite, however Im still in love with their Oatmeal cereals and granola!"
A1AJY4M502J8YY,5,"Ok so I love oatmeal cookies they are amazing. And this is one that I approve on for its soft gooey and chewy. It is absolutely amazing. I love it, and would recommend it to anyone that loves oatmeal, and the raisins are sweet they do not taste tart and are not overpowering."
AZFX7FLEHCWXM,3,"I love oatmeal raisin cookies, really love them.  So, I am always on the lookout for a good cookie...especially if they are made by someone other than me.  When I got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said ""Why not?""  The cookies come 6 to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy."
A1NM2P8DXA5SME,4,"I was pleasently surprised about how soft this cookie was.  It had great flavor, I couldnt even tell there were raisins in the cookie, which is great because I dont normally like raisins.  I like that they come individually wrapped so that all the cookies don't dry out when you want to eat one.  Great snack to take on the go!"
A11OQ0NZAVHYRF,4,Theses cookies are yummy and soft even with raisins my toddler likes them. My only problem is one cookie had 170 calories and is not remotely filling. It's not the healthiest snack but it sure is tasty!
A3CPU6NZNKB5JA,5,"Love single served cookies and they are a perfect as a pick-me up. I don't cookies in the house, but this one can stay all wrapped and waiting for the perfect moment"
A4JHEO7H330AF,3,"QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils)."
A20VX7F4164FVC,4,"I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, ""store bought"" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT ""low calorie"", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly ""good"" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to ""homemade cookies"".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie."
A3UJRNI8UR4871,4,"The folks at Quaker really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.<br /><br />I would have liked more raisins, I couldn't hear ""it thru the grapevine"".<br /><br />Good nutrition for a cookie."
A3H7AOFQDPU0JV,4,"Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are ""moist"" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!"
A2WE93LJX8PMT1,4,"The box says, ""soft baked oatmeal cookies"" and that is exactly what you get!  The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for ""on the go"" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!"
AQZH7YTWQPOBE,5,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies."
A1SK3L2IQLYA8S,5,"This oatmeal cookie was delicious - soft, full of raisins and not too sweet or sugary.  Full of whole grain, I feel confident eating this cookie and giving it to my family to eat as well.  Great item to have in the bag for a quick snack that feels like a treat and is filling too!  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster for introducing me to this product!"
A3QD59N3M7O7KB,4,"Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!"
A1LXHDQLA5KKPW,5,me and my kids loves this.. so soft and healthy and soooo good... easy packed and grab and go... I cant stop one just one... lol
A3D0G7ZGY2LCOG,4,"These cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  While they are 170 calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  They are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  They are almost as good as mom used to make!"
A2TVFGPP29X71T,4,I sampled this product for the Influenster Mom Vox Box that I received in the mail.  I am purchase Quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the Quaker brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis.
A1IGV3GVF39FTV,5,The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins were so moist with a fresh baked taste.  They had just the right amount of raisins to make them taste just like home made cookies.
AIEH19GTFWHWP,5,I recieved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal and Raisins Cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012. My husband and kids devoured the cookie before I had a chance to look at it or taste it. So this is what they thought of the cookie. It was sooooo good according to my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. He is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. I gave this product a 5 star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!
A19T8PEUYFHVI1,5,"Tried the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They were so good, nice and soft,fresh and just the right amount of raisins. Even my kids liked them. You have no idea what you are missing out on if you don't try them."
A2Y5RGO9LX00ZU,4,"I like soft cookies, but most of the ones you buy taste ""fake"".  Really enjoyed the Quaker Soft Baked with Raisins.  I recieved a sample in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and loved it.  I buy them to use as quick snacks, taste sweet and delicious but are healthier than other options."
A1ZA9B6TVX961P,5,"Quaker made with whole grain oats very soft ,healthy &  have rasin naturally flavored ,healthy product. Have iron 8% , fiber 4 Grams also calcium 4%."
A2VR6YZXKXT92K,4,This cookie was very moist but it did not crumble when you took it out of the package.  It was full of flavor but it didn't satisfy your snack hunger.  I will definitely be buying more of these
A3FD1NNRSGJK33,3,They are really soft and somewhat fresh tasting but i thought they had to many raisins.i dont think i would buy again.
A137YH5V6LGYSS,4,I received a sample (Oatmeal & Raisin) from my Mom VoxBox and love it. Not to sweet and very moist...just right.
ASKUUQZA96A9,5,MY SON AND I TASTED THESE COOKIES FROM A MOMVOX I RECIIEVED. WE HAVE HAD THESE COOKIES BEFORE AND LOVE THEM

AFA6AQYWF86LD,5,"When I opened the packaging I was surprise to find one of the best tasting cookie I have had in a while. Not only did it taste great, the texture was perfect and it was fresh."
A2VIQC85IQDY90,4,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies have an old fashioned Grandma inspired taste and texture.  They come individually wrapped making them great to stick in a lunch or in your purse as a snack.  For kids and adults alike.  Added nutrition with real whole grain Quaker oats!
A2JUFDHXAAO637,4,Definitely were a delicious cookie. I would recommend to anyone who would want them. Quaker has made another great product.
A2KWW2PZ514318,4,"I got the opportunit to try Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster in my Mom VOX BOX.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chewy, soft-baked cookies made with wholesome Quaker Oats and delicious raisins. They are cookie and not as moist as a bar, but wonderful none the less. They offer the following benefits:<br /><br /> -Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving"
A1CP5T5KS9JYMU,5,"They are awesome and addictive with cold milk. Perfect snack on the go. A little expensive for single serving one pack but, worth it:)"
A221B1QEPIMA04,5,My kids absolutely love these cookies and theyre healthy too! and as a mom i dont mind my children eating these!
A3IY593AEFLXER,5,As part of Influenster I received a Mom VoxBox full of great products to try and review.  Included was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie.  I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)
A2HEZW3C03DRUF,5,"This is one of the best tasting, soft cookies we had in a very long time!  The kids were fighting over who had the last one!"
A3KTOQWIOAX1JW,5,these cookies are very soft and moist.. my kids love them!! my kids cant wait til i buy them again!!
A2QSSUDOVXD1HF,3,I have to say they are good. Not the same as if you made them your self. If you like quaker you'll love them.
A3KIC82J3VLT8Z,5,"My boys ask for these cookies over and over. Of course, its easy to buy them for my family when they are so healthy for them! The fact that they taste fantastic doesn't hurt at all!"
AXXHSR6EEJ6X3,5,We received some of these in our Influenster boxes and it is my opinion that they are sooooo good! I highly recommend for children and adults! :)
AHAZBZRLMI76F,5,"this product was affordable, great texture, good nutrition and perfect taste. i will definitely purchase again. i received it through the influenster program and am very grateful to have been introduced to a alternative to my keebler cookies and oreos with a much more beneficial eating experience."
A2LJGODTPOLNC8,4,I love these cookies ! My kids love them too I had to fight them just to get a bite.  I would recommend these to anyone
A4QLFGSATC1VT,5,I enjoy the fact that they are so soft and taste homemade.. No after taste like alot of cookies or oatmeal cookies.. And its healthy instead of a lot of sugar and empty cals
ARGYM4CYRRZ26,4,"Great when you're in the mood for a good, filling cookie! They are soft and tase great, and they're better than chocolate chip especially for kids."
A2J48R128QPIFB,4,My family and I tried the Soft Bake Oatmeal Cookies and we loved them. I personally like to put them in the microwave for a couple of seconds to warm them; then it is just like a fresh baked cookie!
A1DTAZVQZAJVTA,5,I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie and oh em GEE.  This was a cookie that was just as good as the ones my Grandma used to make when I was little.  I shared half with my son and he kept saying MMMMM MMMM mommy MMMMM!  Highly recommend this cookie to anyone!
AL8S8MDWIHC9Y,4,"I loved how the cookie was nice and soft when I opened the packaging. It seemed to be made of fresher ingredients. I decided to split the cookie in two and let the kids each have one side. I had to split it because the package only had one cookie in it. My daughter devoured it, my son...he saw there were raisin's in it and freaked out. K ended up eating her brother's half as well. I was bugged for days by her for another cookie so she must have loved it since that's how 3yr olds express love for food! (I WANT MORE COOKIE!)<br />I didn't get a chance to personally try the cookie, but over all it seemed good and from a brand that I like and trust, it also smelled pretty yummy!"
A32KQ885GJ2NJ1,5,this cookie is amazing i couldnt think of a better snack for my daughter during the day to give her  it healthy and it taste great  and i loved how soft the cookie was
A3ES0W45XG5ESS,5,These cookies are very soft and chewy! This cookie is perfect for those sweet tooth cravings and its a healthy option.
AQ55JT0NA0N2X,4,"Received these in my Influenster box for Summer, taste great and very soft. Seemed to be a healthy alternative to regular cookies just concerned as to how much they will cost."
ANLNI4ID8VPXA,5,"These cookies tastes so good. If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave before eating, they taste like they just came out of the oven. Very fresh!"
A36RCVPH79KR3J,3,My family and I tried this cookie and we all had different responses. I thought it was too sweet and did not taste like I home baked cookie. My husband thought it was too dry and crumbly and my son thought it was yummy.... he is 9.
A1F7MPKNEDH58N,5,I only got to eat one little bite of my sample from Influenster because my son stole it and ate it!  Ha ha but the bite that I did have was amazing.  I will be getting more of these to keep in the house.
A2WAUZQVSEFR6T,5,"Quaker wins again with these delicious cookies.  I was particularly loving the individually wrapped aspect of the oatmeal raisin cookies.  I hate opening a box and having half of the cookies go stale because the air gets to them.  These are so easy to throw into your bag or just grab one when you want and they are always fresh, soft and yummy."
A14DTJI4FMG9RB,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed trying out the Quaker soft-baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies as part of the Influenster program.  The cookie was moist, soft, chewy... everything an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  The taste was superb - just the right amount of cinnamon & nutmeg - and it was super filling and held me over perfectly until dinner time.  When I tried them out, I was 8 months pregnant and constantly hungry, so for a cookie to be able to hold me over for that long... color me impressed!"
A3MHX1GH2BISFE,4,"Awesome cookies . Great snack to have in the cupboard when you want something quick and sweet. The quality is amazing , worth every penny and then some."
A24G65GFCTVQYE,5,"I love these cookies, I will have to hide them from the kids because although they would be easy to throw into a lunch box they are nice and healthy for a cheat every now and then."
A224YTXYA2ERH1,5,I just got done reviewing the quaker soft baked cookie line via @influenster and #momvox! They were absolutely amazing! Soft and moist perfect snack for adults and kids the same.
A3UYC2W3K67LS6,5,"I HAVE A SON WHO IS VERY PICKY AND HE LOVES SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES. I RECEIVED A FREE COOKIE FROM INFLUENSTER AND HE TOOK IT, I TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO LIKE IT BECAUSE IT WAS HEALTHY FOR HIM BUT HE WANTED TO EAT IT ANY WAYS AND HE LOVED IT. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT 3 BOXES OF QUAKER COOKIES FOR MY KIDS."
A3T23AA1XLC42D,3,It was very tasty and soft. It was a little dry for me but my 7 year old loved it. I have a glass of milk with the cookie and it is a nice treat.
A2ERLLB9NI7B1G,5,I received this product to test courtesy of Influenster and Quaker and I have to say they are a hit in my house. This was the first product we tried out of the 5 we were sent to test and it lasted less then ten minutes in my home. My toddler was anxious to give them a try and I have already purchased two more boxes since we tasted the first one. They will definitely be a staple product. I love that they are from a trusted brand and I love that they are made with whole grains and I can feel good about my snack choice!
A26U86H6TY5JGJ,5,Delicious and perfect for on the go. Kids love them and they're healthy for them too. I like how they taste home-baked and are soft and chewy. You can even heat them up slighly in the microwave for 5seconds and theyre perfect. I recieved a sample from influenster for free for testing and review purposes. Thank you.
AR1T36GLLAFFX,4,"This cookie package was featured at the local supermarket, so I picked up a pack for a road trip I was going on.  I liked the fact the cookie was soft (probably the reason the cookie was individually wrapped), and the taste was almost as good as homemade.<br /><br />Four solid stars for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie.  Just shop on price; if the price is good, you'll enjoy your treat."
A125PQOOOVJY22,5,This was delicious! Add a glass of milk and you have a kids favorite snack! If you love soft cookies these are perfect for you. Wish more came in a box!
A2YJEUS6Q1A7WD,4,"I got a sample of one of these cookies through influenster.com. After trying the cookie they sent, I went and bought a box of them. The kids love them!! They are a quick and easy snack on the go. They are a bit crumbly, but well worth it to see their smiling faces."

AYXJ9HSVWX97S,4,"After trying this cookie I can honestly say it was not all that bad...however, I did notice a vitamin like after taste that at times was a bit over powering. I also didn't like how crumbly it is but your gonna eat it anyway so I can over look that"

AA72FD1EH0SE9,5,"I absolutely loved this cookie. I received this as a free sample but I couldn't just have one so I went out on a search for them and found them at my grocery store. I was so happy because that one big cookie was everything I have been looking for, not too sweet, not too bland, not salty, not too many rasins and most of all not many calories. The perfect snack, especially with a cup of tea and a book..."
A3T9XUHNVHA00A,5,I enjoyed these cookies. They are delicious and not too sweet. The price is very affordable. I received the product to test and went out and bought a box.
A1KUT7PV7XTO23,5,This cookie taste wonderful.  What's even better is it is good for you too. It does not taste like you are eating oatmeal.  It is a great treat or meal on the run.
A33Y649K8M9W6D,4,"My daughter loved my free sample of this cookie from influenster. She goobled it right down, which i didn't think she would. She's not the biggest fan of rasins. I tried a bite and thought it was kinda dry myself but if my daughter loves it, i will buy it again! :)"
A34W04PFTEIBQV,5,my children love these cookies and so do I. They are soo moist and delicuos. These by far are the best tasting oatmeal cookies I have EVER had.

A223904M7JA86Y,4,This cookies are delightful. They are easy to grab and throw into the kids lunches or snack bags and they are healthy too. I will definitely be buying these for the school year.
AKX8QXMRZUZ9K,4,These cookies are so soft. They taste great. I would buy these for my family if we did not make our own.
A3RL40YTFBMCCO,5,"I enjoyed this cookie.  I did receive it as a sample through Influenster.<br />It was soft and enjoyable to eat.  I really like how they are individually wrapped.<br />Specially since we seem to have a ant problem.  I will buy this product again, specially<br />for my grandkids.."
A1S9BQR8HDWGG8,4,I got a sample of the Raisin Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster in my Vox Box and it was nice and chewy. I love soft cookies and this was great. I will buy a box next time I go to the store!
A2BNMHJ3IIANUJ,5,"I love the Quaker Soft Baked Raisin Oatmeal Cookies. They are by far my favorite.  When I don't feel like baking, or it's too hot to do so, I grab these.  They live up to their soft baked claims.  They are also even better heated for a few seconds in the microwave.  Definitely almost as good as homemade."
A1XLKL4K3I618Y,4,"I tried these oatmeal ones and I loved how chewy they were and they weren't bad taste-wise.  I just think that for the price and how few you get in the box, I'd rather make my own.  But if you aren't great at baking, you should definitely buy some!"
A1HO8OJF8EPK5C,5,"These were amazing! Out of the oven fresh, and full of flavor! Best store bought cookies I have ever tried."
A2ME0LULEQCY7O,5,"These cookies are fantastic! I usually don't like ""Chewy"" cookies because of their textures but i just LOVED these! They tasted amazing! They tasted as if they were just made! Warm them up for a few seconds in the microwave and bam! Yummy ""fresh baked-like"" Cookies!"
A3HGUSZHOYI2B1,5,Very soft and chewy. The whole family loved them and I usually don't like raisin cookies but these were very delish!
A358LEKEN0GDFL,5,"Loved them!<br />I opened the box and got the items out and took a picture. My son saw the cookie and got super excited. I opened the cookie and took a bite then set it down to grab a drink. I came back, and it was gone! My 3 year old had destroyed it! lol.<br />We both agreed it was really good and ran out to buy a box of them. We enjoyed them together that night after dinner with some cookies. Yummy!"
A3EK4A6SVZZ8DC,4,I received one of these Quaker Soft Baked Cookies in my Influenster Mom Voxbox I was hesitant to eat it as it was 170 calories their are lower calorie alternative snacks out there and cookies but this is as close to homemade as you get i liked that its soft baked and breaks apart easily the overall taste was pretty good as well. Not a purchase for me unless they were to cut about 50 calories from it.
A26GHQOTRZMGG8,4,The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies were delicious! They were soft and chewy and full of whole oats. My kids gobbled them up and wanted more. I had one with my chamomile tea and the kids enjoyed theirs with milk. I would definitely recommend these cookies for the whole family.
A2VIXOQOV4DH3U,4,These are pretty tasty and filling. If I have no time to eat these hold me over til the next meal.
A354VQXQCGIQZ2,5,These cookies are excellent and the kids love them too! I recieved them as a sample and went out and bought a box the same day!
AX3V4W4Y891BO,5,"These cookies are great! They are super soft and chewy with a great texture. My kids LOVED them, and they are moderately healthy."
A15LKTKJ2PSQU3,4,"I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie from Influenster.  I thought it was kinda crumbly, but my daughter and I loved it."
A2CI1KCN3DSOT9,4,I got these from influenster to try and they are so soft and yummy. Would recommend these to my friends and family.
A3O0F5L5I6EMI6,5,My 4 year old absolutely loves these. They are always soft and taste super fresh and so easy to find at the grocery store.
A10HCDJHR436EJ,3,I dont like how it tastes because i don't like oatmeal or raisins but if you like them then i think its good to eat these cookies because they're healthy and you will probably like the taste.
A1C7KM3C4IFVG0,5,I would definitely recommend getting these cookies.  They taste awesome. Great snack at home or on the go. Really not pricey. Everyone should try them!
A3BYKK0TFKRC22,5,These cookies taste so good. They are fresh and moist! I like that they are the perfect size and that they are individually wrapped.
A1X97AA5LSO28Z,4,Not really a cookie lover and specifically not and oatmeal & raisin fan but it was really tasty and fresh!!  Received this as a sample.
A3J3MFGC8VVZ2K,5,"In our house we LOVE love LOVE cookies! So this cookie was put to the test, and it totally passed with flying colors.  The tase of it was just so delicious and soft. My daughter (5yrs old) loves these too.  So I don't mind giving this to her because it is a healthier cookie."
A27RSLNCI9W48H,5,"Loved these. Received them in my influenster voxbbox. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Kids love them too. They taste good, they are nice and soft and the packaging leaves them fresh."
A2VANQZJ50SDKH,4,this is a good cookie very soft and moist I wished they made an oatmeal chocolate chip my kids loved them and I would buy again
A20F84KUBWM88B,5,"These are very good, the pack I got was stale, however they still had great flavor to them and are soft & chewy!! They are also a great size and are very filling on their own!! My son has taken them to school for an after school quick bite before sports, and i love to have them at work in case I am starving and know lunch is getting pushed back in the day. They are really great, and if you have tried their oatmeal breakfast bars these are kinda like them, but not as heavy!!"
A2ZJDGVJ45AR5W,4,Quaker always has high quality products. I like these cookies. They have a great texture and great taste. And they are a good size.  Individually wrapped in foil packets for freshness. Good taste with a nice hint of cinnamon. If you like cinnamon you will love these cookies.
ABC68JUCPTVOE,5,"These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).<br /><br />Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Fiber!  4g per cookie.<br />- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.<br />- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None really.<br /><br />Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.<br /><br />Recommended."
A25UCQ4V0THJIJ,2,"I got these in the momvoxbox from influenster.I am a cookie lover,however these were not my favs.My toddler loved them but he will literally eat almost anything sooooo that doesn't say a whole lot."
A29BA6LLBLJILF,2,"I am a cookie lover, so I was excited to get to try this product for free through the Amazon Vine program.  Unfortunately, these are just not very good.<br /><br />They are too crumbly, almost powdery, as if maybe they weren't baked enough.  The flavor is okay, but certainly nothing special.  They are soft, but the texture is not pleasant.<br /><br />They remind me of ""Grandma's Cookies"".  Except they are about half as good."
A1SXCGBJ9JW2MO,5,"These are a very filling and great tasting.  As a quick snack, when you don't have time for a meal, or a super simple quickie breakfast; these are a very good option.  I highly recommend them."
AWKZAUC0D8DYL,5,"My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies."
AECVYXIL9791R,3,"These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something."
A2S3MUP7B22XIC,3,"They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie."
A28YBL28P03P8V,3,"One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these."
A1EEMRCN80LZ90,5,This is a great product. Moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go. This is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day.
A1BCIUKGX6N7AI,3,"Tasty cookie!  It was soft, though maybe just a little dry.  The raisins were actually nice and juicy, not all dried up like in most packaged cookies.  Pretty good overall."
A2F9UFVDZ7MU6P,4,This cookie is big enough to share! I love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you!
A3DIBRGX84SA4E,5,"I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The Quaker Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.  This will be the ONLY type of soft cookie I will buy from here on out!  I love the quality of Quaker products!"
A2Q9SY78G449KO,5,These cookies are so good and soft as promised!  Def recommend them to anyone and everyone that is looking for a good cookie at a good price!
A3NTM6QNFJ33KP,5,I love Oatmeal Cookies so I was really looking forward to trying these.  They are so good and soft my favorite combo with a oatmeal cookie.
A577RLM624AJM,5,quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies are so good they are soft which is a plus and the taste is great
A25TXAWGXMD7SX,5,"I tried these when given to me to review. I will (and have) get more of these! Delicious! I love the chocolate more than the raisin, but that is purely personal preference on my part."
A296VN3YRF44CE,4,"Mommy and kid approved!  I had the opportunity to taste and test Quaker Oatmeal Cookies in Raisin from Influenster and I was happily surprised by the texture, taste, and yumminess.  The kids loved them and didn't even notice the raisins.  I would recommend them for a great healthier snack!"
A2EDBL0WCXTZ37,5,"The cookie is very soft, chewy, tastes great and good for you. Provides a good sourse of fiber. You fins almost at any store."
A10YPORPPZQEWX,4,These are so yummy and I love to eat them! You have to try them they are sooooo yummy! Very great product and worth the money!
A2APLHETAO56C,5,"After trying these for a review for Influenster, I ended up buying a box of these because they were so good! They are soft and they come in individual packages so you can just take on the go. My kids loved these too and since they are a lot healthier then other cookies, I will definitely be purchasing more."
A386ZPWEV03PW5,5,"I got this is my Mom Vox Box from Influensters to try and my little daughter ate it right up! She thought she wouldn't like it because of the rasins but, she loved it!!! She said it was very soft and yummy! She said it reminds her of grandmas cookies! It tasted like homemade cookies she said! She loved them so much she asked to buy her more every time we go to the store!!! I was very impressed!"
A2F07C7I04VROQ,5,"I will absolutely purchase this item.  I received one of these in my Voxbox, and liked it right away.  The flavor is delicious, and it has a chewy, soft consistency (which I prefer in cookies)."
A1KF8IJAV6YM4U,5,I received this product to test as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.com. As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!
A3C7KTR1AJFLAV,5,i receive this at a mom voxbox influenster.com i love this cookie its sooo yummii i will buy more of this cookies
AEEVLJ7BYX0XO,4,"I received this product to test as a part of Influenster.com. I really don't like oatmeal cookies, but this was definitely a mind changer. It was so soft. It was mouth watering when I smelled it. I smell all fods before I eat them, especially if I am unfamiliar with them,don't ask why, because I don't know lol. But these were great and it was gone before I finished looking through the box. These are definitel great for healthy snacking and I know kids love them dearly. I can't wait to try the other cookie flavors! Thanks Quaker"
A28LV7CHO84L0V,4,"I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from influenster.com. It was delicious. My only complaint is that is was a little crumbly, a little too messy for kids. Perfect for me however and I was not sharing so it was fine :-)"
A16ILKBW93JOQV,4,I like the taste and the texture...i personally dont really like this flavor but its actually pretty good :) it passes my picky taste.
A2V62Y7O1GCF0N,5,"The first thing I noticed when unwrapping my Quaker cookie was the smell. I smelled fresh baked good as soon as I unwrapped my cookie. I received the oatmeal raisin cookie, I'm not a fan of raisins but I was willing to give the cookie a try just based on the amazing smell. When I took my first bite I was in love, the cookie was soft and moist and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. I totally recommend people try this amazing cookie for themselves."
A3Q6DHPCWYBB34,5,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I received this cookie in my moms voxbox from influenster.com. I am not usually a cookie person unless i am baking them myself, but in this case i really enjoyed this cookie. I was even more surprised by the nutrition facts, a cookie good this good should not be good for you. I will definitely be picking up a box on my next shopping trip."
A2EMTE0N2OEZBA,5,I have been buying these cookies since they first came out and my family loves them. I have bought every flavor they had and there wasn't one that they didn't like. I will continue to buy these for my family. Great price and delicious!!

A1ZQCV5OTBDDYM,5,"I absolutely loved these!  They are soft, chewy, and irresistible.  They are not quite like homemade, but darn close.  I had a hard time eating the sample that I got from Influenster.com.  Both of my children asked for one bite and then were begging for more."
AVYJR4PZSMC7J,4,I received one of these cookies from Influenster and I am always reluctant to try pre-made cookies because they make my teeth hurt. I was pleasantly surprised when my teeth didn't hurt and the cookie made me think of cookies from my childhood. The cookie was fresh and was soft and I am not a huge fan of raisins but honestly I enjoyed them in this cookie. I will be buying a box of these as they are a great snack item for the kids.
A2MFSX1QO1O6XL,3,"The kids LOVED this, but I mean, hey it's a large, soft, chewy cookie, of course they are going to love this. Hubby is a little more accustomed to my homemade cooking so he could take it or leave it. I thought there could be a few more raisins in it.<br /><br />Thank you influenster for allowing me to try this product."
A38O1ORC6DMIC8,5,Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite cookies. These are very soft and the raisin are moist. Will definately be buying more

A1MSW4GEXW0B9M,5,"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Quaker and Influenster. I didn't hardly get it out of the box before my 2 year old spied it and had to try it! We split the tasty cookie and both really enjoyed it. I have since bought some of the crunchy Quaker cookies which are really good too, but I really do like the soft, chewy oatmeal raisin cookies for my daughters. It's great afternoon snack and easy to pack in my purse for trips to the zoo or swimming. Also, since there Quaker cookies it's a brand I trust and have used for years so that makes me feel happy about the choice I'm making for my children."

Quaker always comes out with really great products! =]

I think it's absolutely brilliant that Quaker Oats has started making oatmeal cookies! They are the experts on oatmeal! I can't wait to see what new flavors they come up with next. So far I've had the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana and they were both very good. I also love the convenient single serve packaging, which is great for my daughter's school lunches."
A2V63C6ND3ECO0,5,These cookies are very tasty and soft! I received a complementary cookie in my mom vox box and will definitely be buying more!
A2SBXS4OLUFH89,5,"Excellent product, very filling, my teenager who eats NOTHING but pizza loves them!!!! Very aforable and easy to carry with you."
A2QVDSOVCS1GM2,4,"I don't usually like raisins in my cookies, but I got to try it out and this cookie was yummy!  It was filling and satisfying, too."
A33F2CZLG4MDOF,5,I like that these cookies are individually packed.  They are really good.  I really like that they are so soft.  They tasted fresh baked right out of the oven.  I loved them!
A28GBNBN8BE3U1,5,My kids loved this cookie!! It was so soft it like melt in ur mouth! I would def buy this cookies again! U will need milk or water while u eat it tho its a little bit drying while eating. :-)
ABFGQOKG43J1I,4,Although not homemade they are as close as you are going to get in a packaged cookie!  They are really soft and full of flavor!  Just big enough to satisfy your sweet tooth too.  My kids really enjoyed these so I will repurchase!
AFZFTS599CAZ1,3,"When I first opened the package, I felt like a little kid again!  The cookie smelled just like the creamy oatmeal cookies my mom used to make when I was little!  I did not used to get heartburn as a little kid, though, and there was the drawback!  My tummy is just too tender for those crazy oats!"
A1HVOIR3GDZIZE,2,I'm glad I got to try this before I actually purchased it.  I would not purchase these.  The initial flavor was ok then it left a kind of chemically after taste.  It kind of reminded me of eating a cookie with the texture of a biscuit.  I definitely needed something to wash it down.
A2RAUWEGFE47AL,5,"The Quaker Oatmeal cookies were absolutely delicious; soft, sweet, and perfect in every way! I will definitely be buying these often! They are very flavorful and just melt in your mouth!"
A1UOPR5GQPDKS,5,"I am the type of person who would rather bake something myself because I am so picky about taste and texture.  Let me just say that Quaker NAILED this cookie!  It's awesome!  Somehow it stayed soft and moist, and tasted like it was baked that morning.  Thanks for a quick, easy and healthy snack Quaker!"
A37F541W7RG5MT,5,"These cookies are so great! They are soft and chewy and taste delicious. I really love homemade cookies right out of the oven, but these taste just as good! Quaker sure makes a great cookie!"
A32JS1R9V5LB78,3,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster to try out and ended up really liking them. I shared the original cookie with my 3yo daughter and husband both of whom enjoyed it also. I actually ended up buying a box the next time we went grocery shopping.<br />The flavor of these is quite nice and the cookies are large and soft. I was impressed with the fact that they're moderately healthy and liked that they weren't too sweet.<br />The cookies are a bit expensive, and I'd prefer to make my own to have more control over the ingredients, but they are a good shopping choice. They're great for short trips or an emergency snack. I'd definitely buy more of them, but not on a weekly basis."
A1VAQPAX16X2OT,4,"Delicious, fresh-baked cookies without the hassle or trouble of making them!  can't wait to  taste more of their different flavors, so yum!"
A103USS4JZN50K,5,cookie was so great nice and chewy the raisans was sweet and moist. everyone should give them a try you will love them. :)
A1UJNBYW8L6N83,5,"QUAKER SOFT BAKED COOKIE IS NOTHN BUT AWESOME GOODNESS! QUAKER SOFT BAKED COOKIE IS DEF A COOKIE IM OK WITH ALLOWING MY CHILDREN TO HAVE ALL DAY EVERY DAY! NEXT ONE TO TRY ..... BANANA NUT? IM DOWN ! U DOWN? ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS COOKIE , NOT ONLY IS IT GOOD FOR U BUT IT GETS U FULL AS WELL....SAY GOODBYE TO MUNCHING OUT ON COUNTLESS ""UNHEALTHY"" COOKIES. WHY PUT THAT OTHER STUFF IN YOUR SYSTEM? WHEN U CAN HAVE A QUAKER SOFTBAKED COOKIE! NEED I SAY YUMMERZ? I THINKS SO ! YUMMERZ ! AND KEEP UR HANDS OFF MY QUAKER SOFT BAKED COOKIE PEOPLE! LOL!"
A22T7TNQPR4Y95,5,I received one from Influenster and love these cookies because it's soft and chewy without being too sweet. I just wish these were more readily available.
A6B6BSUWGCBC3,5,I received this Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie in my MOMVOXBOX from Influenster and when i tell you this cookie was soft and chewy and so delicious i dont even like oatmeal raisin cookies so i was very hesitant at first to try it. But after i took that first bite i was in love and i instantly went to the nearest walmart and bought a box of quakeroatmeal raisins cookies. This is a product that is worth a try and you also try the other flavors too and hey i even warm my cookies for a couple seconds in the microwave to get the fresh out the oven warmth going on but like i said try it. This cookie is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A34UI1G8JJ1E4Q,4,"I was recently given a package of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I'm already a huge fan of almost all Quaker products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol). They were good sized cookies, individually wrapped to ensure freshness, and had a delicious taste. Now I'm craving them! Overall, they were a great cookie! I'd definitely purchase them again. Can't wait til they're back in stock on Amazon!"
A13SGME8HN4P3U,4,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies taste closest to homebaked cookies than any others I have tried. My kids loved them, too. They are moist and flavorful. We like them as a snack, or even as a breakfast on the go!"
A2B4SEB40GSX9Q,5,"Very very tasty! I received a sample cookie through influenster! This cookie was an amazing guilt free treat! Moist and full of flavor. I had an oatmeal raisin, but there are other flavors. Definitly worth buying. Much healthier than other cookies!"
A2PWKW64LW71NU,5,This was a great cookie.  I was very happy with how soft it was.  Being in the individual wrapping made it easy to through in the diaper bag or purse.  My 18 month old son loved the cookie.  Would love to have these in the house at all times.  Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies.
ADJ1WJUZ7MM4P,5,i love this cookies so does my family bought more this week when we went to the store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack
A3IMO49QD6OYKN,4,"Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says ""soft-baked,"" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 6g (9%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 3.5g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg (5%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)<br />Sugars: 12g<br />Other Carbohydrate: 11g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass."
A23RZIU0N8K2KR,5,"My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with."
ADX0OP5C8DX1T,5,"This is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. My youngest child is 6 and isn't much of a sweets eater. However, he found the sample I received from Influenster and he LOVED it! I have to say, I was a tad disappointed that he didn't save me any but he assured me it was ""yummy"" Will definitely keep these on stock."
A1805KET2CBE7U,5,These cookies are great! They are very soft and have a great flavor. Perfect for taking on the go for the kids.
A2MWHLLN4QZ6BQ,5,I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. Let me just say that it was so yummy and delicious! After sharing it with my kiddos I was left wanting more. I will definitely be keeping these cookies on hand...the whole family loves them!
A35K68AM80H2LI,5,"My kids and I absolutely love these cookies, already on our 2nd box!! I am excited to try all the different flavors, good cookies and they are so tasty!! Yum"
A2IQGEH7O523PL,5,My daughter and I absolutely love theses oatmeal cookies. Has the right amount of sweetness. Very soft not crunchy like most cookies. Taste like what grandma would bake at home.
A1IJ0LJ66CFXBE,5,"I received the Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie as part of my Mom voxbox from Influenster.com. It was the first thing I took out of the box because I was hungry. I was honestly expecting not to like it. When I first opened the bag it smelled very fresh. I took a bite of it and instantly loved it. I loved how fresh, soft and chewy the cookie was. I went out and bought more so my husband can also have some, he also loved them. They are a great on the go snack."
A1CHOKV10NEI8X,5,"Good oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />You can pretend you're eating something healthy.  When your marathoner, vegan, 4% body-fat co-worker says, ""Cookies?"" in their smug, disdainful fashion, you can reply, ""No, it's oatmeal"".  Then cram another seven in your mouth, 'cause these are *really* good cookies.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court"
A332BS08Q1MFYP,4,"I love oatmeal cookies!So I decided to try these out.Well I'm a really big fan of these cookies. Their good, tasty, and it's easy to eat when your busy in the morning or you just need a quick snack. You can even heat these up a bit in the microwave or have them cold, it's great either way. But the one complaint I have of these are the raisins, I don't know they just didn't taste that great and they kept getting stuck everywhere my mouth.Glad I tried them though!!"
AAJZWCB1SJSFB,5,These Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious! They are SUPER soft and taste absolutely wonderful. They are made with whole grain which is always a plus and are naturally flavored. My daughter loved them too. We will probably be getting more next time we go grocery shopping!
A1864W3OZW3WBS,3,Quick Take:<br />it was a C+<br /><br />Usage Tips:<br />good for kids if they come pre-packaged. kids liked it.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br />Didn't quite taste home made. too much molasses? too many carbs.<br /><br />love the commercial of the woman biting the neighbors cookie.
A3J73C6CCLJ6RK,5,I got a sample on the Oat Meal Raisin from Influenster.  My kids really loved the taste and we have since bought more.  I think these are great and better than having candy or something else less healthy.
A2631U0YHK1WCH,5,"I Love these cookies , i have had the oatmeal raisin and the chocolate chip ones and cant wait to try them all mmmmmmmmm good !!"
A37CK3S671ETN6,3,These cookies were okay. My 2 & 6 year old sisters loved them but I don't think I'd buy them for myself.
A3RG3Z3DW9T3PM,5,Def love these cookies! I let my kids eat it. I don't feel guilty afterwards! Pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to make them extra soft :)
A3T1IQ2K0CT39G,5,"I received one of these in my VoxBox to try, it did not make it into the house! It was delicious! Very soft and chewy, flavorful, full of raisins! Absolutely loved it! I can't wait to go shopping so I can get a whole box of these!"
A3D6ISMLB8ZASC,5,These cookies were delicious! I love that they were individually packed so I could throw a couple in the diaper bag without having to fuss with pre packing snacks in sandwich bags.  The cookies stayed moist and yummy until snack time.  My kid loves it and so do I.
A3JFXO59HP0JHV,5,"these cookies are super yummy! I love how they can be a quick, tasty and healthier on the go breakfast option.My whole family loves them!"
A13WHL0WWA8TFJ,5,I tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie's as a sample through Influenster.  They were so soft and tasted just like homemade.  It is exactly what I expected from Quaker!
A277TO3PKKNYDH,4,"Three years ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It sucked. There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. With a variety of flavors there's sure to be one for most soft baked style cookie lovers."
A29LYTN6L7HO0Y,5,"I received a Soft Baked oatmeal cookie in my VoxBox and was very excited to try it. I am always skeptical about the cookies that are advertised as ""soft"". This one truly is. I tried to save some for my husband but it didn't sit there for long. I wish my oatmeal cookies turned out like this!"
A1TP69D7MIMXDF,5,"I absolutely love these cookies! They taste just like homemade Oatmeal Raisin cookies that Grandma would make! They are a good sized cookie too, not the teeny tiny ones like most companies make!"
A3RMR57027OCQA,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are so good! They taste like a homemade cookie! If you want that right out of the oven taste try heating up the cookie for about ten seconds. It will be warm and soft!
A19HHHP1EJ68TG,5,"I received a free Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit for me. I love this cookie (but of course I share a little piece with with my husband). I could not put the cookie down, it was so good that I went out and bought a box of the almond with chocolate chips. Can't wait to go and buy more."
A1CD68FSHCEWX6,4,"I saw these when they first came out so I decided to buy a box. Unfortunately I didn't realize they also make a crunchy version and I grabbed that box by accident. While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon."
A3E57MWLSEA8Q7,5,From bbwife31: I received a free Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from Influenster and it was an instant hit in our house. My son devoured almost the whole thing in 2 minutes. The few bites that I got to eat were super delicious and I am not even an oatmeal raisin kind of gal. It was very moist and flavorful. Will buy again in the future!!
A1BE8C29T5B7Z8,4,"My son really enjoyed the cookie. He is not a big raisin fan, but the soft oatmeal he liked. I think there was a good amount of raisins in it for the average cookie. I love the single packaging, makes it easy to take a snack on the go."
A233BH1G1DPGB6,5,"A delicious little snack, can also substitute for breakfast in a hurry! The kids weren't so thrilled but what mom doesn't love a snack that's safe in the pantry?!?!"
A31LJUC9RK3G1B,5,These cookies are soft and delicious. I am very picky about my oatmeal raisin and Quaker delivered! No Trans Fat is a BIG PLUS!

AQTFRRTUH7K9B,4,I am pretty picky when it comes to cookies because I like homemade cookies. I tried the Quaker Oatmeal Raisin cookies and I really liked it. It tasted homemade and was soft and chewy. It was a big hit with my 18 month old too!
A1G2F4L08EMS24,5,I tried this cookie and LOVED IT!! I have a four year old who is obsessed with anything sweet(but hey who isnt?) an and she absolutely loved this cookie as well. We will definitely be purchasing this again...Thanks to influenster.com for sending us the sample to try out!!

A29WJDD28NBNM3,5,I love oatmeal cookies but not from a package.  I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are and actually taste home baked!  Good job Quaker!
A4GXZVYP51AGS,5,"This cookie was absolutely delicious. I received it free in my influenster Mom Voxbox. I only had 1 bite since I shared it with my boys but it that one bite was good enough to tell me it was delicious. It was soft, chewy, satisfying. My kids loved it and wanted more. We have even went and bought some more when we went grocery shopping."
A3VRJ78CCIMV7Z,4,I loved the chewyness of the cookie. I was initially worried that it would be cloyingly sweet but the oatmeal gave it a lovely texture without adding too much unnecessary sugar. Will definitely purchase this product. Thanks to Influenster I got to try this product for free!
A2FZI0BTON78GQ,5,"Very soft chewy, and yummy! Heat it up in the microwave for a few seconds and it tastes even better! Definitely worth trying not hard ,not to chewy and not to sweet just right. Kids love them 2 :)"
A1A44YPXT10IAL,3,"The cookie minus the raisins, which I don't care for, were great. Its rather tasty to have such a high nutritional value. I am interested in trying other flavors."
A2TM93IL4MGJW3,5,"I got a free cookie, from Influenster.com a few weeks ago, and it didn't make it for much longer than 5 minutes.<br /><br />I opened my box, I got my stuff out, I went to get my camera so I could make an ""unpacking"" video, and when I got back, the cookie was gone, and there was a really guilty looking 5 yr old sitting beside the empty wrapper.<br /><br />So I never got to try it. :( But judging from the satisfied look on my daughter's face, she LOVED it!"
A3FGXDP2117TD7,4,These cookies are great for in the morning when you are in a rush and don't have time to make breakfast they are so tasty! They are even better warmed up. These are also great to keep around for the kids for snack time or to put in there lunch box for school.

A1V1ZNXG5WF0IM,4,"Mmm! I think that about sums it up. I love how soft these are. I couldn't stop eating them and I'm ashamed to say that I want to buy more. Bye-bye, diet. :("
A1L35WM9O8VEFQ,5,this cookie tastes soo good im really not a fan of raisins but when i tasted this cookie it was like another thing i really recommend it its so good and delicious
A2699NLN1UWFRO,4,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test from Influenster via the Mom VoxBox. My 3 year old son loved the cookie - each cookie is pretty large, very soft and full of raisins. If you buy a package of 6, they are individually wrapped which is great for travel. It is great that they are made with whole grain Quaker oats - and that they have a nice helping of raisins. They are still a cookie though and have 12 grams of sugar per cookie. I did buy a box for my son for an occasional treat."
A2C65ETCGML2CG,5,"I recieved one of these to try out in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. I am not a huge raisin fan but I really enjoyed this cookie. So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again. The cookie was super soft, great for my 1 year old to eat. It was also big enough that I could split it between both kids. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a delicious cookie."
A1ZBMC42IE96C1,4,These were surprisingly tasty. My kids loved them too and they are a great on the go snack. They offer a quick pick me up and aren't too messy in the car when on the go.
A2PFH1741A25BG,4,I got a free bar in my voxbox from influenster and wow!! Soo yummy!! It melts in your mouth and even my 2 year old loved it!
AX9JKBZJERV9G,5,"Was fortunate enough to receive this in my mommy Voxbox :) I've tried these delicious cookies before, but it was the first time I had shared one with my son. Needless to say, he loved it. I believe it was good because it somewhat melts in your mouth & is really easy to chew (he's 2) .. I will definitely be repurchasing these for us!!"
A2Q2WA62JJTUCV,5,I was able to try this yummy cookie when it came in my momvox and i have to say i don't like raisins but when i took my first bite i was very amazed at how good it tasted i would defiantly buy theses for myself as well as my family
A1Z16COUTNK9SC,5,"I got this cookie as a part of my Mom Box from VoxBox. I'm not too keen on oatmeal cookies, but this one was surprisingly good. I guess I'm more used to them being hard so I really liked the soft chewiness of my cookie. Now a chocolate chip one would be fab!"
AGJGJSFWS80NV,4,"These are amazing, soft, and fresh! They taste great and I bought more after I got a free sample from my Mom Vox Box from Influenster~~~ so yummy."
A9TK6DNW9DOKZ,4,"Great brand provides a great cookie.  They are soft and have lots of flavor, definitely worth your money.

I can't wait to try other kinds!<br /><br />[...]"

I'm usually not a fan of oatmeal cookies but these were so soft and moist and had me wanting more. Not only are they good but they're good for you, they're low in fat and high in fiber so they make for a good afternoon snack or evening dessert. I can't wait to go buy more at the store!"

AF8BD13PX00JX,4,"Quaker is a trusted brand that has always had great products and this in no different. The cookies are soft , chewy and very fresh. I love that the cookies are individually wrapped for easy snacks or lunches. Its a treat that I feel good giving my family. Will be buying in the future!"
A12270M2NQN1QC,4,"I received this cookie in my mom voxbox. This cookie was soft and delicious! My kids usually only eat cookies with chocolate chips or M&M's in them, but surprisingly enough, they snatched it from my hands and gobbled it up! I love that it is only 170 calories per cookie, 4 grams of fiber, and 8% iron, making it a good snack. I only wish it had less sugar."
A3OPOL3MUBPVL9,5,"I tried the best cookie ever from Quakers! I never tasted a soft, fresh cookie like Quakers Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. I was one of the lucky ones to receive a Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012 (complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster). The Voxbox comes with several items and one of the items was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie. It tasted like a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie. The raisins, the oats and you could even taste the cinnamon that's in the cookie. It was so delicious, even my kids loved it! I have 4 kids: 2 year old, 3 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and they all enjoyed a piece of the cookie. The little ones even started crying when it was all done. So that definitely means I have to go out and buy some more."
A29DRL3WYLVVW4,5,"This is going to be the fastest review you have ever read because this is a great cookie.<br /><br />Thoughts: This is a really ez and fast way for you and your kids to snack on the go, a great way to get your fiber, and its for you.<br /><br /> The Run Down: If you are a fan of oatmeal cookies then you'll love these. They are soft and chewy like the name says.<br /><br />The Final Say: I have bought them for my family and my little one loves them. We talk them every where. They are about 3$ for a box of 6. All in all i give these 5 (*****). Ill keep buying them for the family. So go get some for yourself!!"
ANYXO3GW3X1X8,5,These cookies are moist just like homemade cookies!!! By far the best store bought cookie and is a must have in any moms pantry!!
A1S313BVVWH0PM,3,I received the oatmeal raisin cookie in my momvoxbox from influenster and it was pleasantly surprised by how chewy and tasty the cookie was considering that oatmeal raisin cookies are usually hard.  I'm not a big fan of the oatmeal raisin cookies but my little brother loved it and i'll most likely purchase the chocolate chip cookies because their a healthier alternative to most i think :)
A2U0C4SWY3B2EZ,5,"I love oatmeal cookies, but sometimes they tend to be too hard or too dry! Not these!! These are soft and great to give to my toddler when he wants something sweet. I don't like to give him snacks with too much sugar and these are perfect."
A1OTKUVYWO7W81,5,"This is not at all what I was expecting, but better! The cookie was so moist and just delicious! Im not a huge fan of raisins, but in all honestly you could not even tell the cookie had raisins, you couldnt even taste them. Absolutley worth the buy, will be purchasing in the future!!"
A2CZPBRPBEFX2R,4,I Tried this product in my mom vox box and it was delicious and soft. My i pinched my children a piece off and they loved it too! We will be buying these more often.
A186PLNGEY2F9X,5,"These cookies are Quaker baked, mom and kid approved. They are soft, chewy, and most of all delicious. The texture and taste makes them seem homemade without the hassle of baking."
AB6RV1AXXKPSH,5,Great taste and healthy what more could you ask for. Most cookies of this type are dry and make you think you are eating paper but not with Quaker they are soft and moist!
AS9IG6PUNJQGC,5,These are so good and soft and chewy! The taste is delicious. I tried the Oatmeal raisin cookies and they were delicious. Definitely recommend!
ADXC3UD7DF5S9,4,"This cookie was actually really yummy.  I'm not usually the type of person to like raisins in my cookies, but these were really good and moist. I will definitely be buying these in the future. :)"
A3FPWLEVW0NXM9,4,I got to sample this for free. These were soft and delicious. I actually left this partially eaten on the counter overnight and it was still soft the next day when I finished it. Which is good because my kids only half finish what they start eating. I thought it was a great tasting oatmeal cookie - just better without the raisins. I'm not big on them but I was able to pick them out. They need these just in oatmeal with no other ingredient - like raisins added.
AM7PBWBB8ATR4,5,"I received this item in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie was very soft and flavorful. Usually you get cookies like this and they are either hard or dry, and that was not the case with Quaker Brand. I'm not a big fan of raisins but they were fine in this cookie. Just the right amount and not over powering.<br /><br />This is one cookie I would purchase on my own, and I'm sure my son will be very happy about it."
A2760OTUCOMBWF,5,"I received this item for free from Influenster in my mom Vox Box. I am not usually a fan of raisins, but this cookie was soft and tasted just like it was freshly baked. I absolutely loved it."
AAS6GEBXE7U4B,5,These cookies are so yummy..<br />They are so soft & don't get stale. I would definitely repurchase these.. I want to try other flavors!
AVLDNUBKKN3YX,5,I received a sample of your soft baked oatmeal cookies in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.  Within seconds of opening the box my kids were fighting over who would get it!  We all got a taste and it was delicious!  I really liked the flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely buy your product again in my local grocery or on amazon.
A1385CL0JY3H7S,5,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br />As soon as I opened up the box, the cookie was on top. My 5 year old couldn't wait to get her hands on it.<br />She enjoyed every single morsel. And wanted more. So on my next food shopping day, I will definitely be picking up a box. GREAT JOB QUAKER!"
AXAOQIZ7AAN4U,5,"I received the Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box and I saw the cookie sitting right on top, so of course I opened it and tried it out! This cookie was so soft and chewy that I am totally buying more as snacks for my little cookie monster!"
AAB7ZUSPDY3F1,5,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom Vox Box.<br /><br />I opened the box, saw the cookie and ate it right away. I was going to save half for my nephew to try but it was so good I ended up eating both halves any way. Nice and soft and chewy and sooooo yummy. TOTALLY buying more"
AQUQ2VHEN1DM7,4,This cookie barely last five minutes in my hands. It was soft & chewy and great on-the-go snack. Its perfect for kids and adults.
ALHVEH9POH57V,5,"I had the opportunity to try a Quaker Soft Baked  Oatmeal Cookie through Mom VoxBox, and whew was I pleased! I took my sample into work and had it for a snack one night. Soft and with just the right amount of cinnamon in their oatmeal cookie!"
A3R0F56KA61O94,5,"Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot. I took one bit of this thinking I'd be giving the rest of it to my 2 year old daughter. It was DELICIOUS!!! Needless to say, she didn't get any of the cookie. :o) Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying this again!!"
A3FX1WWPD1VZJW,5,"I am a huge fan of soft cookies so this is top of the line!  I love how soft and flavorful they are.  since they are individually wrapped, it keeps them soft and fresh!"
AOWF7FPRT84IG,5,I put this is my dad's lunch because he always wants something sweet but I want him to eat healthy. I'm a health-nut & the ingredients in this cookie didn't scare me away. My dad said it tasted home-made (in a good way) & seemed really fresh. The portion size was also good.
A4H1FCXY3U4VO,5,I didn't even get a chance to eat this because my 3 sons STOLE it from me.  They LOVED IT!!! I will absolutely buy these again!!!
A2AN7ZKER5JGX9,4,Im not the biggest fan of oatmeal but I really liked this cookie so much that I went and bought a couple boxes!
AKOO2TYRAMHLO,4,I really liked them they was the best box of cookies I gotten so far I will be getting them again real soon
A30ZOQNOAACUG6,4,I received a sample of the Quaker Oatmeal cookie in my Influenster voxbox. I'm not a fan of raisins so I let my daughter try it. She loved it. She said she enjoyed the raisins and liked the soft cookie instead of a regular crunchy one.
A37MAQ1WG6S4Q6,4,"The Quaker Cookie, was a great soft cookie to eat. My 3 years old daughter really enjoyed the treat! It was soft, there wasn't any after taste to the cookie.. Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the Quaker Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)"
A3MMZB52PZ8CLW,5,"I received a sample of this product from Influenster. My daughter and I split it and it was delicious. I'm going to have to check Kroger to see if they have them, because my Walmart did not.  :("
A1E0J81HK6J05J,5,"When Influenster and Quaker sent me this cookie to try, it looked delicious--but healthy-so you never know!  But, I was delighted because it is good for you and Great Tasting!  Love it!"
A22A2K7WND9HK8,5,"These cookies are great! So yummy! My little boy loved these cookies! Since they are in individual packages, they are great for purses and diaper bags!"
AD5YFE22UHF8W,4,"Quaker has yet to disappoint.  I am not a big fan of raisins, but these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are the best!  Very chewy and fresh, great for on the go or kids lunches!"
A55FHH9UVJHV8,3,I thought the cookie was good. It was soft and chewy; however I prefer organic foods and would much  rather have a freshly baked cookie!
A2A6E1GDC23AH9,5,These cookies were so very scrumptious. They taste homemade and I won't lie... I gobbled it down in mere seconds. I will be purchasing many more.
A3KK1N7BUXHIVD,5,"Wow, a soft moist & delicious cookie~Quaker has done it again.  Great snack for on the go or to enjoy at home with a nice glass of cold milk.<br /><br /> This cookie is large enough to share with two if you have little ones.  The added bonus is its nutritional value!  Grab a box and enjoy!"
ABDQ2MRN5WCHJ,5,These are great especially for little hands.  I love how soft Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are.  My son really can't get enough of these things!
A1F3P86HABN49V,5,"Love the cookies!  I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this was.  I am not usually a soft cookie fan but this one was an exception.  Also, this is a pretty healthy choice if you are craving sweets."
A1GSUAY824143X,5,"This cookie was great. It was a little soft, but that's what made it even better. It didn't take long for it to vanish, which might be a bad thing if you lack self control (something I do not possess). I recommend these to everyone unless you are allergic to raisins."
A2ZGAYM73QA32R,5,"This cookie is so soft and taste amazing! I was so surprised with how moist and chewy it was, better than home made, believe it or not. My whole family were begging for more, highly recommend trying this!"
A3EDAIXNN61MZD,5,I received this cookie in my Influenster voxbox and LOVED it! It tasted just like what I would make at home. Delicious!
A1NATKZWW6EJAK,4,I received this product thru Influenster and Quaker in my MomVox box. I opened it jn front of my 8 year old which he took off running with it and later came back and told me that he needs it for his snack at summer camp. We went out and bought a box and he takes one every morning for camp. Love it!!!
A17RZLRLBH8HHM,5,I have tried this from Influenster and its delish! I also purchased more of this because it became my son's favorite snack! Love it too! :)
A5I0ADFJGYV8L,5,"I received this cookie from Influenster and Quaker in my Mom VoxBox. I was so excited to get the chance to try this cookie. Then it came and my youngest took it before I got the chance! I was so disappointed but from what I understand from him it is one of the best cookies he has ever had, and it tastes better than the cookies I bake him at home."
A2TTHN1UMO82VY,5,"The Quaker Oatmeal cookies are deliciously soft, the cookies are individually wrapped, and I like that because you can take one package on the go and have a good snack a healthy one. I like this Raisins cookies a lot."
A1P27BGF8NAI29,4,"Quaker Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)"
A2YPGQH2UGGTM2,5,No-one should do oatmeal better than Quaker ....right? Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.
A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,4,"These cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. Very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!"
A1SVXJZ3386U2D,3,I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality
A2IT7S59GSASN7,3,"Maybe it was the hot weather? Maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br />These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.<br /><br />Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.<br /><br />Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced."
A3B9C6MZAFC1JX,3,"These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products."
A1YCV76MUFESR1,4,"I really liked these cookies. They are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. They worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).  They aren't coated in sugar the way a lot of prepackaged oatmeal cookies are.  Each cookie is individually packaged and is easy to open on the go.<br /><br />I'd totally buy these the next time I see them in the store."
ABNMD6670TV53,4,"Quaker is pretty much the oatmeal company, and they have done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie. I liked the convenience of being individually wrapped, which also preserves its freshness. I take one of these along during a round of golf and in my lunch. The cookie is tasty, light and moist. I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin."
AOXMWBNDZDJ9L,3,"These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.  The taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too ""processed,"" not like simple and fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.  I would not recommend them personally, although my little ones liked them fine (although I rarely know kids to say ""no"" to a cookie!)."
A17OGRGX1EMDRR,3,"I got to this in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I don't like oatmeal cookies. So I had my daughter try it and she LOVED it. She said ""Mom, this cookie is really good. Is there another one. I only got one."" I told her no that, that was all. She was really bummed. But I told her that when we go to the store and if we see them we'll make sure to buy them since she likes them so much."
AU2SKKGEM27QB,5,"Cookies are delicious and very soft, i expected a much different taste but to my surpise they were actually great. I got a sample so i will be purchasing these for my family soon."
A380DEMZPD1C8I,5,"I was given a chance to sample this cookie when I got my Mom vox box from Influenster and Quaker, much thanks. The kids and I shared the cookie it was soft and chewy really good we will be buying them again."
A2B2M5YQZPBOA3,3,"I was really excited to get this Quaker Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft."
AXBO8IITQB0FH,5,"I recently tried them and they are chewy goodness!  Be sure to try them heat them up, oh your going to love them/"
ALTK95MGGJGX,5,I just wanna say that we are completely hooked on this cookie now! My kids love the product as well! Especially with all the nutritious qualities of the cookie and the great taste! We are def sticking with this from now on!!
A2IEKQUYATR8UX,5,Love at first bite! Very moist and delicious! Definitely recommend to everyone who is a fan of Oatmeal Raisin cookies.
A1RXZ4CABWPVN,5,"I recently tried this product through my influenster mom vox that I received and I have to admit that I am not a big fan of cookies HOWEVER this has to be the best cookie I've ever tasted thus far so much that I ate the whole thing before I could even record my youtube video, lol."
A10Y723SWU2WHZ,5,"This is the best prepackaged cookie I've ever had! They have great flavor, are soft and chewy, and just everything you would expect in a homemade cookie! I was given it in an Influenster voxbox and I can say that I will be purchasing these very often!"
A2AYGK8D17XJMR,5,i actually tried this cookie through influenster is was really chewy which is how i like my cookies i dont like them hard and crunchy its very good but the after taste left in you mouth is kinda nasty but overall one good cookie
A2IIDRHZMGK3E5,5,"i received this product from influenster to test!!.. i loved it it was so soft and delicious i would have not bought this if i went to the store because it is ""healthy"".. but after tasting it i will definitely be buying more!!"
A2CTFMY2YL0KQO,5,"I recently tried this cookie as part of an Influenster Mom Vox Box.  Influenster sends out free boxes of products in order for you to test them and give them your feedback. I really enjoyed this cookie!  Most packaged cookies are hard and taste like cardboard but I was pleasantly surprised that this cookie was soft and comparable to a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie.  The nutritional facts weren't too bad for a dessert too.  It was very yummy and filling.  A good sized cookie!  I will definitely be buying some for my family, since I ate this one myself ;)"
A3FTRK4S2H4LOK,5,"I received a free cookie from Influenster, and it made my week. I normally avoid packaged cookies because I like the chewy freshness of homemade so much better. These had an amazing flavor of cinnamon and spice, and the texture was perfect. I need to go get my own box!"
AJQK1B2Q4NCHU,4,"I was given a sample of these Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster.com as part of their Mom VoxBox 2012 for reviewing. I shared my cookie with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. As with any cookie, she loved it! I thought the cookie was delicious. Not overly sweet, but had perfect flavor. It was moist too, unlike some cookies that are dry. My least favorite part was how crumbly it was. It did have a tendancy to crumble quite a bit. Overall, it was a great cookie."
A2ZFOWI93B94G4,5,"I received this delicious treat complimentary of Influenster in my Mom voxbox. I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)"
A1ZW99N6T7E0FJ,5,"I got the opportunity to taste test these awesome cookies from Influenster and Quaker in their Mom VoxBox and found the cookie to be absolutely delicious! It was soft and chewy, just how I like my cookies! My four year old and I shared it and half was enough for each of us and he loved it too!"
A25CD3H4FMV6IT,5,I received the Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies from influenster in the mombox. I was very pleased. Not only was it a great sized cookie and was also very soft. It was not dry and it tasted great. i will definitely be purchasing this product!
A1PC8WIZSF8P6R,4,"I received the Oatmeal cookie complementary in my Influenster Mom Voxbox and I couldn't be more impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the taste! I will definitely be buying more, especially now that I know they come in these amazing flavors!! Yummy! They are great to have on the go and especially delicious warmed up with some milk!!  And they are not too expensive on the calorie bank either!"
A334VH4XXBMNIB,3,"I tried these cookies as a sample from influnster.com. They are a little sweet for my taste, the kids loved it. They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!"
A30K6FX9TGESXS,5,"I received a cookie as part of an Influenster review. I love that it tastes like a fresh cookie from Grandma's oven. I knew I would love it, but was uber pleased to see that my 2 year old loves it as well. This is definitely something that will replace a fruit snack!"
A3SRANSNTP8WV4,5,I received a complimentary Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster.com for review purposes. This cookie is huge and hearty! This is literally the first Oatmeal Cookie I have ever been able to get my picky teenage son to eat! Very soft! Just like homemade! Quaker has really outdone themselves!
A37F6ROMBNWVNQ,4,"I received this item from Influenster and loved them so much thaton my next grocery trip I purchased three boxed.  I received the oatmeal raisin from Influenster and I also purchased the banana nut and the chocolate almond.  The raisin was my favorite soft and moist, loved them"
A337SZO4X5CVYJ,5,"These cookies are amazing! They are moist, flavorful and are really satisfying. I can't wait to add them to my teenagers lunches in the fall!"
A1E4JTG9X3AZQS,4,"I was really surprised at how good these are! Very soft and chewy, however maybe a little too soft. I recently packed them in a lunch and got complaint that they crumbled"
A1FL751FIQ1K1F,5,"These were very tasty, my three year old son even gobbled them up! They are very soft, and as long as you like oatmeal cookies you will love these!"
AUZNNV1ZYG8J0,5,Yumm yumm yumm we loved them like that way they are soft for the kids and they taste so good
A2N5RWQ4ND7DIW,4,"Bought these for my husband and he really likes them! I haven't tried them yet, but I'm going to give them a shot."
A1LP4E8DPMHGZT,5,"For an Oatmeal Raisin cookie this isn't bad at all. Nice and soft, great taste. I like the other flavors of this cookie as well."
A251WX1Z4SHFDD,5,"I got a sample of these yummy thangs in my Influenster Mom VoxBox and they are delicious! I shared mine with my toddler and she also loved it, cried when we ran out of cookie! They are nice and soft and really tasty! Go on and get you some, girl!"
A296X4ZUJFBAMY,5,"I love Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. They taste so good! They are moist, soft, and just the right size! The first cookie i had i received in my Mom VoxBox from influenster.com. It was so good that the next day I went out and got a whole box! They are great for on the go snacks. I keep one in my purse for when I need a little snack! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KK56JU"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies 6 count box (8.8 oz.), Raisins (Pack of 4)</a>"
A2K4QDSGBJI172,4,I also received a sample of this cookie from Influenster.  My daughter really enjoyed it. I think it is a little high in sugar to make it a regular treat but I would repurchase it in the future.
A3KK11UQ3X6FR7,5,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:<br /><br />-Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving<br /><br />Definite buy, if on sale stock up."
A4YUXXZ0DGHJD,4,I recieve sample of this cookie from Influenster to try out. I normally dislike cookie with raisins but this one was good. I will not get these again but thats not because it wasn't a good cookie its because of the raisins. I will how ever try these in other flavors.
AWJGALJ7YIG67,5,"I love these cookies. They have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. The opinion expressed herein are my own personal opinion and have not been influenced by Influenster or any other third party."
A28GJHVEB3ZFV1,5,"I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there."
A3HHL4JYO9PU1U,5,I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were much more moist then other brands. Also I like the fact that it's made with whole grain quaker oats and it provides a good source of fiber. These are a great thing for kids to eat!! [...]
A21KQYQLNSFCKW,5,"I received a sample of this product to test from Influenster.  I have been a big fan of oatmeal cookies all my life and I put this right on top.  What really impressed me was the sofeness and the taste was just awesome.  If I didn't know better, I'd think they came right out the oven. Lets not forget the wholesome ingredients it contain.  You couldn't ask for a better cookie.  If I didn't know better, I think my mom made these."
A362PVPSOJ579X,5,"I received a cookie from Influenster. I am not a big fan of oatmeal and raisin cookies,not since my Granny spoiled my taste buds. Ever since then I have tried to find cookies on the market that were comparable to hers, with no luck. I was surprised by this cookie! It tastes so close to the homemade ones that my Granny used to make!! The size is enormous and the raisins are soft and chewy. Definitely worth buying! LOVE IT!"
A1T2BMX629OT2X,5,I really dislike oatmeal cookies and raisins..I got a cookie from influenster and this cookie was awesome and made me change my mind about oatmeal raisin cookies. I would def. get these again.
A2RDJVM7WHUD1B,5,"I am not a big fan of raisin cookies, But I had a taste of their raisin oatmeal cookies & they were delicious ! I am surprised my son loved them too. He had no clue there were raisins in there, They were just that yummy (: I will def be buying more of these. Thanks to Influester for sending me a sample in my 2012 Mom VoxBox."
A17UF5BSDY0M9F,5,I love these soft and chewy cookie from quaker. The cookiew was better than what I expected from a store bought cookie I will buy again
AEOLQOH7KKSSB,5,I got to try the Raisins Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster via the MomVoxBox.<br />So much flavor! This cookie is just so yummy chewy and soft and delicious. You have got to try it to believe it!<br />You just want to eat every little piece. An awesome treat!
A2E1IB0RZP8TQC,5,"First let me say that I tried this product because I received it in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster as a complementary test product.  That said, these cookies are off the hook delicious.  They really do taste just like homemade (I know, because I make my own all the time).<br /><br />I only ate a bite because my son was chomping at the bit to have it and as soon as his little hands got ahold of this cookie, it was gone in seconds and he was asking for more.  We'll certainly be buying a box to keep for when it's just too hot to turn on the oven and make our own!"
A2RKUXWZKVTZ8L,4,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were truly much more moist then other brands.  They had a good oatmeal flavor and were packed with raisins, but were not as sweet as I expected.  After a few bites, I found just a little bit of the cookie was the perfect amount to fill me up and calm my sweet tooth.<br /><br />*I received a free sample of this product from VoxBox in order to provide an honest and accurate review."
A1JT2WNZ60UWRB,5,I was Fortunate enough to be sent this item through influenster. I really enjoyed the cookie. It was delicious soft goodness that didn't make me feel as guilty as eating an Oreo<br />Thank you Quaker!
AXXTETPBEC9TM,5,These cookies taste fantastic!  Even my picky children love them and ask for them every time we go to the grocery store!
A1V37KXOOGAIH8,5,I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster and Loved it! These cooies are one of my favorite packaged cookies.
A18NMBZTHPVZOL,5,"I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster to try.  I am gluten intolerant so my seven year old daughter got the pleasure of trying it.<br /><br />Here is here review:  ""I loved this cookie.  I loved it so much i could eat a bunch of them.I loved this cookie it was so good i wish you could give me more. It was worth five in rating that's how good it really was to me. I wish mommy could try it but it was not gluten free so she could not try it so that was sad. But i loved it.""<br /><br />I have a feeling this will end up in our cart our next grocery trip ;)"
A2ON4K5SOER4YD,4,"I love these cookies, they are soooo soft and they taste delicious all of the flavors. They are also not to chewy."

ASSD9LJYESYG0,5,"Thanks to Influenster I got the chance to try these yummy Quaker soft baked raisin cookies! It was love at first bite!I like the fact that it's made with whole grain quaker oats and it provides a good source of fiber. All in all, the soft, chewy, homemade taste makes this one a tough cookie to beat."
A2M07Q8FOXN3WR,5,"These are some of the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever - I usually bake my own cookies but to be honest I'm not sure I can do better than these!  They are soft, melt in your mouth and bursting with flavor."
A21Q70ARD2XHN3,5,This product was great! My kids love them and they are a healthier option when you are on the go!
A1HY9S31V7EY9N,5,Just after getting this cookie I ate it right up! I love my cookies soft and oatmeal cookies aren't normally the most moist cookie. These had such a great flavor even better than my own homemade ones. My family was not happy that I ate the whole cookie without sharing!

ADXWHZUTXSLNE,4,"These cookies are great to toss in to lunch sack or to grab one on the way out the door. It makes getting a treat more then just eatting the cookie it's something that can be share and experienced anywhere, anytime."
A3UXGVJWFDIC4T,5,"The cookie was soft, moist and delicious.  You can tell they are packaged fresh as they don't have that stale taste.  My kids and I love them!  They are definitely worth the money."
A3E65GJTEAOC9M,5,"I was pleasantly surprised how good this cookie was. To be honeset, I only got to eat 2 bites of it....my 3.5 year old gobbled the rest up!! She's not a big breakfast eater, but she enjoyed this cookie. The raisins were nice and plump, not dried out and hard. Very impressed with the size of it too. This is a great cookie."
A3BI1YF9YAARW2,5,"These are perfect for on the go...we are often rushing out the door and I often grab something as the door is closing.  These are perfect to fill you up and give you the start to the day that you need.  My youngest is not a morning person and is slow to eat, so these are great for him to just grab and eat on the way to school.<br /><br />Was so happy to get a sample of these in my MomVoxBox...thank you Influenster."
A2RPNN823U333Q,5,"I received this product from Influenster. I have to say the kids devoured it before I got the chance! They asked for more! So, it's added to the grocery list."

I like to eat a little something before I workout, and this cookie really hit the spot. My little kids also really enjoyed them! They are begging for more. Perfect snack for the little guys."
AZ46YG5P7DE5J,5,I will be going to get more of these tonight! My 15 1/2 month old son just loves them and I like giving them as an afternoon snack for him. They fill him up and give him the energy for more running around and they don't seem to bother his mouth since he's currently teething.
A1BE3OH7TH8JY9,4,These cookies are delicious and healthy.  I will be buying these to share with my family. Quaker couldn't have made a better cookie!
A2UEL7CRDCMG0R,5,"I was lucky enough to try this cookie in a Mom VoxBox from Infuenster. So glad they gave me a sample because I would have never tried it on my own since I don't really like oatmeal raisin cookies. This cookie was delicious, not too sweet, very soft and chewy and my 17month old daughter also loved it. These cookies will be found in my house from now on."
A3MIVT8IBWSC0R,5,Amazing cookie i not one to like oatmeal and raisins but this cookie was really moist and soft. I was so good i bought the other flavors chocolate chip and the berry ones. This cookies are great for the on the go food just throw it in ur bag and go A++++++
A1GUFMEKC67DMZ,4,These were really good. I got them free to try and loved them. Very filling and tasty. Me and my husband shared it and we couldn't wait to buy more.
A36EMFO4RUN7QM,5,Wasn't sure if this cookie was going to be as it was described but it was more than what I thought. It was so soft and I love soft cookies I tried the rasian one cant wait to try the rest
AG509WZ4O3ZVE,4,I am not a huge fan of raisins but the Quaker brand has always been one I loved. I did try the cookie and it was so soft and melted in my mouth . Had a great and healthy taste of whole grains and overall is a good Cookie.
A2TSHCT7EUO6S6,5,"I really enjoyed these cookies. Great taste and very filling!! Great to pack in lunch, picnic- kids snack. Great that they come individually wrapped- easy to throw in your purse or bag. I would recommend these for kids and adults!"
A26NNDKQDICMZN,4,i am not an oatmeal cookie lover but I will say that I loved this cookie !!!!!!!!!! it was soft and chewy and that what makes it good
A2DGR4QV3GOVQD,5,They are amazing. So good and soft chewy. I so recommend them.my kids evwn enjoyed them. I will be purchasing these
A3OGTIDOCYMJUJ,4,These were pretty great. We got the Oatmeal Raisin but to me they tasted like Pumpkin Pie which was even better. My husband and three year old liked them as well. Especially the three year old. These cookies were pretty great. Very dense so one is definitely enough. I want to try another flavor next time too! Maybe something with chocolate!
A2ZW5BCB2YWT39,4,"I recently received a sample of this cookie, and I enjoyed it!  The cookie was soft and not too dry.  It was a little spicier than I generally like my oatmeal cookies, but it definitely had some flavor. I wouldn't say that it's my favorite oatmeal cookie ever, but I would be very okay with eating more of them  :)"
A1RJG9FR4WMW1B,5,"This individually wrapped cookie was moist, soft and chewy. The taste was perfect and it was beyond expectations, the perfect bite."
A3JAXGSXU195WV,4,"Oatmeal is one of my favorite grains and I was very excited to try these cookies, especially a soft variety.  Very yummy!"
A1NX3551JZ765N,5,The oatmeal cookie was so soft and chewy. It really was very yummy as well as healthy. Will definitely buy more!
A27V6FWDG69G6X,5,We recently got one of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies to try ViA Influenster and Quaker. And my family loved them! They don't taste store bought at all. They tasted home made!! Very soft and moist!
A1NQ7WS4WKJ427,4,"Upon recieving this cookie in my voxbox from influenster I sceptical because you expect cookies in a package to be very dry and more often than not tasteless, the cookie recieved in the package was surprisingly moist and very flavorful, it tasted very good and I will definately purchase them in the future."
A13Q5LKLFYEF3Q,5,"My daughter and I tried the soft baked oatmeal cookies and we both agreed it's delicious!  I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.  The oatmeal doesn't overpower the raisins and the raisins don't overpower the oatmeal, it's a perfect balance.  The raisin were soft, not hard like other brands we've tried in the past.  The price for the quality is well worth it."
A3AL8ZMEYAJDFB,5,"I absolutely fell in love with these cookies.  I love my cookies soft and not hard, unless it's an Oreo and then I soften it in milk, but these cookies are hands down the closest I've had to homemade!"
A399Z7W6AJWTAV,4,Less calories than a candy bar! I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available.
A39LRXUCO3GOSO,5,Got a free sample cookie from @influenster's Mom voxbox. These cookies are great they are soft and chewy and left me wanting more!
A2E6C8G3WQJXQF,4,I was given a sample of the Quaker Chewy oatmeal cookie from Influenster. I enjoyed the taste and texture of my cookie. I will buy them again if they are on sale or I have a coupon to use.
AP6Y5XI9MQBJW,5,"There is one thing that I love, I love eating something absolutely delicious and knowing that what I am eating is actually healthy and jampacked full of nutrients!!! I received a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and it was delicious, and you know what else? My little sweet toothed diva, loved it too, I know this because she took it from me and made it disappear like magic! You want a healthy treat that you kids will love and enjoy too, this is a definite must try."
AVKM2FDS36L41,5,"Greta cookies and amazing nutrition in them. Would definitely purchase this product. ,y favorite part was the delicious oatmeal put in them."
A2IT7A6SKJELLN,5,These are very good. Nice and soft. Would for sure get again. Since they are packaged individually its nice for travel. A great snack.
A3FT1TX9WE7A5B,4,I received these cookies to try from Influenster and they were delicious! So soft and yummy and not too small like some store bought cookies are. They tasted homemade and the whole family loved them!
A18K25LOCI0KH,5,We received these to try and they were fantastic my husband loves oatmeal raisin and he couldn't get enough! I think the verdict is that they're fantastic and we'll definitely be buying more!
A38RA1ZDO7RFZQ,4,liked the flavor just wished it had more oatmeal in the cookie. But i do like how soft it was!!
A3BFCHN39OF5XL,4,I loved the softness of this cookie but not to keen on oatmeal but I will be buying more of these just not in that flavor. my kids loved the cookie!
A3FD3BHIUYIFPD,3,"I've always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son.  he loves soft cookies, so I was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives."
A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,4,"The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me)."
A2I3XS9TO93Q0F,3,"Nice flavor, and only 70 calories per cookie; the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying."
A3K8AU6BAGN60E,5,"These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an ""oatmeal"" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies."
A2NW5UDW32JSV2,4,"These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices."
A47D5C32VLQM2,4,"These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either."
A37D2TGTIXRV2N,4,"These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced ""soft"" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don't expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I've had worse (Chips Ahoy ""chewy gooey"" for instance)."
A335GUD1YBS31U,2,"These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are ""soft-baked"", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don't taste that good.<br /><br />I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter."
ALBW2ZBS6Z2AY,3,"I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative."
A4SD8F79JBYG2,4,"For a product like this, it's pretty good. Soft, tasty, seemed fresh. They didn't last long at my house. I thought they were a bit too sweet, but the kids loved them. I'd rather eat home-made, but this is the next best thing."
A2J4MMO1BX5AI1,5,"Quaker cookies have always been one of my favorites and these do not disapoint. These cookies are so delicious! They are soft and chewy and scrumptious. My kids love them, I love them, this is definitely on my shopping list :)"
A3L9SN34TI9YMX,5,I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try the quaker cookie.  It was soft and amazingly delicious.  My daughter loved it as well.  Will definatly be purchasing these in the future.
A2ZMWF79SFRJ4V,4,I received this Oatmeal raisin cookie from influenster and they were so delicious! They were soft and moist and I will definitely get these in the future for my family!
A13XHH6I82E1OJ,4,I received a sample of this cookie and oh my goodness it didn't let me down.  It was delicious and tastes a lot like a homemade cookie you'd make yourself!  I loved how soft it was as I prefer soft over crunchy cookies.  I'm definitely interested in checking out the different flavors they offer.
A2QOIPT15C6YFX,5,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies were super good!! I think everyone should try them out!! they and they are not to bad a snack health wise!!

A3DHLLD8Z3YTHR,5,"I got a sample of this cookie from Influenster.  I just have to say it was soooooooo delicious.  I love oatmeal cookies and even though I always use Quaker oats they never come out as soft and delicious as this cookie was.  Forget baking, I'm buying from now onw."
A35CV6DQ289M4N,5,"I received this cookie from Influenster to try and review. Mine was raisin flavored and It was yummy! I would recommend this cookie based on price , easiness to find and purchase, and flavor/ softness! As close to homemade as you can get without the work! And reasonably healthy as well! yummy!"
A6B8K2EMIBT0Q,5,"I loved the Quaker Soft Baked oatmeal cookie that I got to test recently! The spices in the cookie were perfect, and the flavor was better than homemade! I'm not an Oatmeal raisin cookie eater, but this was a soft and Delish cookie that I truly enjoyed!"
A25L8SFZEIS3W5,5,I recieved this cookie sample  complimentary for testing and review from Influenster.<br /><br />I let my neighborhood kids test this out. (see pictures below) .  It was easy for them to open and they loved the cookie itself.  They asked me to go buy them some for snacks.  Here is the information about the cookie
AM7G28JMONYMO,4,"This was one of the best soft cookies I've had in a while that was store brought. I am not a big fan of raisins but this cookie made me forget all about them. If you are thinking about buying these, they are a good buy. A Great snack for Adults and children."
AIIIJRZ9O7WPN,5,"I was desperate for something to eat but had to rush rush rush out of the house for a family emergency.  I hadn't eaten lunch yet so I grabbed one of these cookies and headed out the door.  As I drove to pick my son up from school, I ate the cookie and was surprised at how satisfied I was.  No more growling or stomach pains.  And the fullness lasted until dinner!"
A215DC8JKGGXQX,5,"These quaker cookies are so great, they are easy to carry around and they make a great snack when you are on the run."
A3RH5OG1NLYWA1,5,"I received a sample of the Quaker oatmeal raisin soft baked cookies (courtesy of Influenster.com) about a month ago and since then I haven't purchased any other oatmeal cookie. I love them and most important my daughter loves them. These make the perfect snack for lunch, at day at the park or beach, or a midnight snack. Best part is they are healthy and don't make you feel bad for ""cheating"" a little on your diet. There's so much to say but to sum it all up....they are DELICIOUS!!!"
A232Q01OI8O3K3,5,I loved it is was so yummy.  I had to go out and buy a box write after I got my free sample thru influenster.com.  My kids loved it too they dont last in my house of how yummy thye are!!!!
A37A8WC76QI2PH,5,"Anyone looking for quick, delicious, healthy snack should definitely put these on their shopping list. They come individually wrapped which makes them perfect for taking along with you when running around and they're very filling with the whole grains and rolled oats."
A25IVQCN6XPGVU,5,"I received one of these cookies as a sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox. I didn't think I'd like it because I'm not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies. The plan was to give it to my husband who loves them. Well, before he could get it, my daughter snatched it up. She doesn't like raisins but loved this cookie! I talked her into giving me a bite and it was really good! It was really soft, not dry. I have been trying to find them in the store to buy some more but so far haven't had any luck."
A2N18PS4RU2WU,5,I received a sample of these in my summer mom voxbox from influenster and as soon as we opened it everyone wanted a piece and we had to share! One cookie just wasn't enough...I'll have to buy more..they were so soft and tasted like it was freshly baked..not overly sweet and the raisins were plump and soft...highly recommend!

A3B08P27RV8NNH,5,I recieved this cookie in my Influenster Momvoxbox. We recieved the Oatmeal Raisin cookie. It was so soft and tasted sooo good. There was only one so my kids and I had to share. Later that afternoon I went out and bought the Oatmeal Raisin and the Banana Nut. Love them!
A1NDDSWYDRLJHF,5,"Let me just say wow!  I was a little apprehensive at first because prepackaged cookies are never as soft and chewy as advertised but these Quakers cookies were amazing they were soft, chewy and tasted like they were baked fresh.  I will be recommending these to everyone i know"

A3PIAD5YFALYUX,5,"My daughter ate this cookie and loved it.  She stated that it was soft and moist and not too sweet.  My baby also liked this cookie, his review was a little more understated though.  He cooed and smiled and tried to steal more from his sister.  I will definitely be purchasing this product in my normal grocery-shopping routine. I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster. @Quaker #quakersoftbaked @influenster"
A267HO0DNITHVQ,4,"I really liked the cookies. My daughter loves the as well as a special to treat to share with me. A little crumbly but that what you get for a real soft and moist cookie and not one chocked full of chemicals to keep cookies fake,y moist and chewy."

AMSQPHKVJZVVN,5,"Quaker soft baked cookies are delicious. I love the consistency, texture, taste, and quality of ingredients. It is a quick, easy, healthy snack for on the go or at home. The raisins are good size and very juicy. This is probably the best soft oatmeal cookie I have had in a very long time. Definitely would buy again."
A3ET6201QA44N7,4,"Almost taste freshly baked and homemade. And the size of one cookie didn't leave me wanting more, it was a perfect little treat. I would try the chocolate almond one next time."
A1AAO0V5MURIDH,5,I thought they would be dry like most Oatmeal Cookies you can buy! Not the case with these delicious beauties! My kids can't get enough of them :) They are on my shopping list for good!
AYUT6BQ68PVGT,4,Ive tired this before but got one with the Influenster VoxBox 2012 this month YUMMy- they can be alittle dry though.
A1GPF475C8GRJD,5,I really never loved raisin oatmeal cookies but this is moist and tasty. i had to buy some more for me and my little ones.
AENQPVTQU5MSU,4,"These are de-lish-ous! They are moist and chewy, ans make a great snack for ant time of day. My kids love them and they are always in my purse when we are on the go!"
A1O9KXI6CAV8K8,5,"i received my Cookie my 1st Influenster VoxBox 2012 this month,  You must buy and try them.  The Cookie isnt too sweet, its soft and the raisins are just right. This is a must buy"
A3TLEHA5T8C82,4,"If you like soft, chewy cookies with lots of raisins, this is the cookie for you. My husband and kids love them and I love them because I'm not asked to bake so often with them in the house."
A337DX7CA20IC9,5,I don't care for oatmeal cookies + I was actually going to give this to my husband. I kind of feel guilty that I didn't lol. But it was really soft + yummy. Making me reconsider only keeping stock in chocolate chip cookies.
A1Z81Z9ZKR1RQJ,5,This was so soft and yummy! My kids absolutely loved it and its perfect to throw in your bag or lunch box for on the go treat.
A30OXXZL7IQMSM,4,"I gave this product 4 stars because of it's usefulness to me. The kids LOVED it and they're not huge fans of oatmeal cookies! I thought it was tasty; however, I'm not likely to purchase it with frequency because I try to avoid packaged foods, and do not store a lot of sweets in the house for the kids. I would however choose this over the competition. (I got this product as a free trial from influenster.com)"
A35SIY7AGE5O7O,5,i love this cookie it was so soft and chewy and oh so yummy!!! not a fan of raisins but the cookie was goood and my husband loved it

AGQY241F3Y398,4,"I received a quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie from Influenster to try and review. I shared this with my son who does not like oatmeal and he loved it! I love that it is made with whole grains and could be a good substitute for an on the go breakfast when I am running behind. The flavoe is very good, I love the soft texture, I really don't care for hard cookies and this one is perfect. I would recomeend this product to others and will probably purchase some more for my family."

When he finished all star to cry and i have to buy some more at the store. now this is a family favorite to eat with milk. Its so soft like cake, i love it, and so healthly to my kids. Try one, you dont regret it!"
A2POA08J9NX44S,5,"So, I got a sample of this product in the mail. After a few hours I thought well maybe I'll try it and it just happened to be the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, but the cookie was gone. My daughter just happened to ""go missing"" around the same time, and she's a mommy's girl and never leaves my side. So as I'm searching for her, I find her in my bathroom shower with the cookie almost ate up. I would have gave it to her anyway if she asked, but she hit it from me and ate it all herself! My daughter is extremely finicky when it comes to snacks, but this she gobbled right up. A cookie you can't go wrong with and good for them too!"
A1U687ZQTPZX0F,5,"I received a free sample of these cookies in my Mom Voxbox thanks to Influenster and Quaker and was very impressed! The cookie is very soft, chewy and tastes great! Microwaving the cookie for a few seconds makes it even better."

A2TQX6DFP0HS0K,4,thanks to influenster i was able to try this product through the mom voxbox. i was pleasantly surprised at the taste but being a baker i prefer my homemade cookies to store bought ones.
A9A6Z3FJ5V7B4,5,"These cookies are delicious.  As a busy mom I don't have time to make home made cookies very often, but these are delicious.  They taste home made.  They aren't too sweet which is perfect for an oatmeal raisin cookie and they are perfectly soft.  These are perfect for a lunch box treat or for a road trip.  I will definitely purchase these again and try the other flavors."
A7AYLRL33D68M,5,My Kids Loved these cookies and they are perfect for on the go. I will be buying again. Great product.

A1VWRTF3V4DHFE,4,"I am not crazy about cookies to begin with. I do however prefer Oatmeal Raisin than any other kind. I like my cookies well done and toasty, whereas these are super soft. They do taste great but just not my preference. My son loved it :D"
AP6GJCC6P8ZNT,5,"these are the BEST single serve cookies i have EVER had !! i have had other brands that were just had a wierd after taste i think because of the packeging, but these did not have that taste, all you taste is the amazing cookie"
A3PQS40IWU4R97,5,I absolutely love this cookie. A great nutritous treat for the palate!!! Perfect for a quick on the go snack.
A39011OV4EWS7V,5,I loved this cookie becuase it was soft and chewy. It is great for when your on the road and need a quick snack between work and a kid's game. Also makes a great treat for kids
A2M10LNS6H5JHM,5,I received a sample of this cookie and loved it.  It was a great snack and will now be part of my grocery list.
A1O4OZHP2LFMB1,5,"These cookies are absolutely delicious, I received one for review purposes from Influenster.com. I took a bite and gave the rest to my son, which was gone before I even had a chance to change my mind. LOL One of the moistest, most delicious cookies I have ever had, hands down. The only drawback that I found was that my cookies was broken into about 5 pieces, not sure what happened, but that doesn't effect the flavor!"
A26AE6PT3QB8UR,5,These cookies are so good. They taste homemade! Very tasty and healthy! Usually I only think oatmeal when I think of Quaker...I was wrong!I got a free sample from Influenster! :)  I will be buying for sure!
AXOTOKR786M4C,5,"When I tried the cookie I noticed that it was very soft, moist, and chewy. I usually do not like raisins, but they were very good in this. They actually tasted like homemade to me. And I grew up with a grandmother who always had fresh baked cookies in the kitchen. Having three kids of my own, of course I had to share with them. My son's comment on the cookie was, ""That's really yummy, Mommy!"" I am pretty sure we will be purchasing these in the future because my two boys keep asking if there is another cookie in my VoxBox.<br />I received a sample of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins in my MomVoxBox from Influenster for review purposes only. All opinions are my own."
A1DQF45ATLZ8OW,5,"This cookie is so good, I received a sample from Influenster and when I opened it, it smelled like a homemade cookie...it tastes so fresh and it is filling, you only need one and you are good to go! I will be buying these in the future!"
A21I3W4M06OC65,5,"Was very happy when I received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster to try! I had seen them on commercials but never remembered to buy them when we went to the market, but I will definitely remember to buy them now!! What a delicious cookie and it is good for you too! Me and my son enjoyed our cookie with our lunch and it was a hit with both of us. It was such a soft and flavorful cookie that filled you up and left you satisfied. I will definitely be trying other varieties of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and will be recommending them to hall my friends!"
A3LXQMXMP0XBH2,5,These cookies are very good. My daughter tried the sample and then I went out and bought a box. The whole family loves them. They are very soft and moist. It is a new snack in our household!
AY8JVIABRH4K,4,"I received an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie in a Influenster box and I loved it! Tasted just like a homemade cookie, really fresh and chewy. I would definitely buy more!"
A3UJ3BGNFZTAL9,5,These cookies where so great and yummy! took my candy craving away!  you should for sure buy this! The rasins are great and fufilling
A21OTVAAYU384T,5,I received Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookie as a sample in the mail. The cookie is really soft and a very nice size. The raisins taste very fresh and it's just like eating a freshly baked cookie; you could even put in the microwave for a bit to get the fresh oven baked feel.
A1CTNAMX1QN5GL,5,Received this in my influenster box my son Loved it! : )  Had to purchase more. It was nice to be able to try something to see if I liked it first before purchasing it.
AJ7K50X3SV5X7,4,These cookies are very delicious! They are nice and soft so i could even give them to my 2 year old.
A1AO6FSK9VZVBM,5,"This morning I gave my son a quaker oats rasin cookie for breakfast. When we took it out of the package it smelled amazing. I wish I was able to try this with him, but I have celiac and am gluten free. However my one year old son gobbled it up. It was super soft and chewy. There were visible oats and lots of rasins. I like that they were healthy. I did not mind giving this for breakfast as a treat because they are quaker oats!"
A86KSYCW6U4Z4,5,"I don't usually like Oatmeal Raisin cookies, but when Influenster sent me this cookie to try, I did, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved it! So great, so soft, and so delicious. I definitely recommend that everyone try this cookie."
A2T7VFBJPVWUJO,5,I received this Quaker Soft Baked cookie from Influenster. This was my first time trying it and ohhh my!! It was fresh tasting. Very chewy and busting with flavor.
AC5JQ2Y7FCL4N,5,I love these cookies!!!! They are very soft and actually taste like the homemade cookies your grandma would bake. Which is a great compliment to Quaker considering I think my Grandma is the best cookie baker ever! I also like that the cookies are a good snack that are not super high in calories. I will for sure be buying these cookies again and recommending them to all of my friends.
A2HZOHKQ3VT4HR,5,"I received this from Influenster in the Mom Voxbox. When I offered to my kids to try the Quaker Oatmeal Soft Baked Cookie I literally had a crying baby on my hands. She did NOT want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says ""I's MINE!"" Even getting a new box ""It's mine"" have to hide it.  Thanks!! Annette G"
A1NLRHC48S1KT9,5,"I know they say ""soft baked"" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!  These are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry."
A3H19949DTO802,5,We love these! They are so soft and tasty. They are a healthy filling snack. So easy to just stick in your bag and enjoy on the go!
A150259WAJ62YN,5,"These were great! These cookies were soft and very tasty, almost like fresh baked.  They were much larger than I expected. Great product, you won't be disappointed."
A2A9AK38AAJHOL,5,"This cookie was so soft, and delicious. I definitely plan on buying more! Perfect snack to have on the go or just at home with a glass of milk."
A2ECOZ9FB1DY0C,5,"The cookie is amazing, very soft. My daughters ages 4 years old and 10 months couldn't resist them. I had to buy another box right away."
A3F9TI0YRFF0C7,5,"they are great, tasty and delicisous.  We even tried the banana nut ones, they were fantastic we loved them.  My kids loved them a great breakfast on the go..."
A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,4,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one."
AM83WJG9BE2EP,4,"Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again."
A30SPABIPVN5MV,3,"This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!"
A35W3JQYP0M655,4,"As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )"
A2PD27UKAD3Q00,4,"Quaker soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!"
A1IDWUYX4QXTUE,2,"I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening."
APMYPD97EHUUZ,1,"I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these ""cookies"". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!"
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF,3,"This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!"
A2H2I5FY1PUHP1,4,"First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for ""store-bought."" If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too."
A1ACM1CBGORBN1,4,"I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how Quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.<br /><br />For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.<br /><br />It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood."
A2YB4886NNF7L8,4,I loved these cookies! My daughter eat them right up. They are soft and taste great. I like softer cookies and this one was a hit with my whole family.
A320NOWKQWX6V6,2,"Chock full of sugar!  Absolutely not something I would serve to my family.  Obviously, all cookies have sugar in them, but these seem to be a bit excessive."
A5UI8IPN6SOSS,4,"I recently received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.  I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two ""cookie monsters"" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)"
A1PVGVHONQI7WU,5,"I got these in the Mom VoxBox from Influenster, and was excited to try them!<br />They are chewy and delish! I can see these disappearing and having an empty box sitting around!<br /><br />I'm not a fan of hard crunchy type cookies, so these were right up my alley!"
A2VTNHHCUFI8JB,5,My 3 1/2 year old loved this cookie!  We shared it and I'm pretty sure he would have eaten the whole thing!  Very soft and th perfect amount of sweetness- not overly sweet like some oatmeal cookies tend to be.
A2LBIC0C82IVIT,4,Very soft and chewy! Love the homestyle taste of the cookie and that it is very nutrious! Definetly gotta get some more!
AC497HNO0E8VH,3,"Well, let me start by saying these cookies are very soft and moist. However, I did not really like them. They were not sweet (which is a matter of personal preference) and they had a gritty texture to them."
A2DEYCMTS79D1M,5,These cookies are delicious. They are full of flavor and taste moist and fresh. My kids loved them!!! My expectations were exceeded!
AJ8HQ860LUJSN,5,This cookie is one of the best cookies that i have tried in a while since i do not like the hard crunchy ones like chips ahoy because it is so soft to the bite and pulls you in to make you want more. You can taste all the ingredents none are hidden and has a good amount of raisins in the cookie. I will be buying these for my family as long as they make them.
A2U6EWZTA418N0,5,"Quaker Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy. I feel good about buying this because the ingredients are simple & I have used Quaker for years. Is a much better alternative than the other regular cookies you see in the store. Packed with raisins & whole grains. Great to pack, on road trips or just in your purse. Kid tested and approved! I received this product complimentary to test through Influenster's VoxBox program."
AN7R8MEQU056O,5,"I have absolutely fallen in love with the soft baked cookies! My kids love them, and I love them as a treat to munch on. However, they also can be used in delicious cookie crusts or cookie crumbles for recipes! They are so versatile and delicious! I definitely recommend them to everyone! my husband isn't even an oatmeal fan, but LOVES these cookies!!"
A2G0VUD19MLPYP,5,"These cookies are to die for. I ate mine in a matter of seconds and was ready for the next one, but I only had one. I recommend these cookies for anyone kids, adults and the elderly. Its deliciously soft packed with raisins and yumminess!! Go to the store now and buy them, you sure wont be disappointed."
A19070W4HLG899,5,"These are soft, chewy, and delicious! They really do taste just like homemade cookies... with natural ingredients. They are a perfect treat, but still feel like a bit of a healthy snack as well.<br /><br />* I  received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster"
A32TM8I2D0858P,5,I let me daughter try some and I ate the rest. She isn't big on raisins but it was still good to her. I thought it was delicious because it was soft and tasted like it was just baked from the oven. I would highly recommend it and who doesn't love a good homemade cookie. Cause that's what it felt like to me. Like someone had just gave me a freshly baked cookie.
A39B3E7CL22OYT,5,"I received this product through my Influenster Mom VoxBox. My son immediately ate it up and said to me it was ""the best he had ever had"". My son is four mind you! So this must mean something. I would definitely go out and buy some for my household after hearing that reaction :)"
A15P6JXOSIN2TG,5,This product was provided to me for free through Influenster. My family love these cookies. They are soft and slightly chewy. My 2 yr old will only eat these oatmeal cookies. So he really enjoyed them.
A2S60IDMYRV6M9,5,I received this through influenster mom voxbox.  My children loved it and I felt great knowing that it is a healthier cookie than others on the market.

A1I5QGRMHP8YSV,4,Received this in my VoxBox and I thought it was super delicious very soft and chewy! I'm going to purchase the pack of 12 this week!
A21PS501QMDKK5,5,"I received a sample of the oatmeal cookies through Influenster, it was a large size cookie so I decided to split it with my husband and my 5 year old son, I didn't think my son would eat it but after his piece was gone he asked for more! Even my husband thought it was great and he does not really like oatmeal cookies. I will buy these now!"
A3E6R53BBVWPZ1,5,"I received a free sample from influenster.com in the Voxbox i got, and my daughter really loved it!! She wouldnt even let me sneak a bit off it, so it must be really good!!!"
A1L43HQE9J36W9,5,I recently received a sample of this Quaker Oatmeal cookie in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster and I couldn't put it down.  The cookie is a nice big size and is full of flavor. Its not overly sweet and has that homebaked taste to it.  I can't wait to get more.
A2L20SNQ4EZJ8B,5,"I received one of these to try for free and review from Influenster in my mom Voxbox and I have to say, it was the softest, chewiest cookie I've ever had. This is saying a lot since I'm picky about cookies being soft and chewy. I'm anxious to try the other flavors. Especially the Apple Cinnamon one! Yum!"
A93OSR5GY3X0I,5,My Husband Loved The Oatmeal Cookie he said that it taste home made. curbed appetite like a snickers would have. He said they taste  natural would try them again.
A2ICI5CWUSBMSS,4,I received a sample of this product from Influenster.com. They were delicious cookies I have to say. I don't usally reach for oatmeal cookies they are just not my favorite or my son's favorite. I love how homemade they taste. Nice and soft real taste of oatmeal and raisins. I will definetly continue buying some of these especially because enjoyed them!.
A2COGE7RR1R09M,5,These are SO yummy! They are incredibly soft and take me back to my childhood when my grandma would make oatmeal raisin cookies. My toddler loves them too!
A2DXPD5YDN83VX,5,I have always loved Quaker brand products.  I had recieved a Oatmeal Rasin cookie through @influenster to try and review.  My boys actually were going to fight over who got to eat the cookie so I did the old one kid break it in half and the other one choose what half he wants trick.  They were left wanting more!  I have already repurchased these cookies several times in different flavors.  I am happy that they are good for them and make a great snack.
A3VAIUS6VZCMEH,5,Quaker Soft Baked Cookies are incredibly soft and chewy! And they taste so good! Definitely the best store bought cookie out there! I received a free sample via Influenster.
A1G7XPJJQA226A,4,"So soft and chewy! It's a great snack for yourself and even your little ones! I recieved a free sample from influenster.com and this was the first thing that caught my eye. It has a great taste, and I can see myself buying more in the near future."

A36MKT48SKZ1EE,4,"If you like soft cookies, then these are for you. Great ""healthy"" snack! Don't  leave 'em in your gym bag though, you'll have a bag of good tasting crumbs!"
A3LKNC9XL2AS05,4,I really loved this cookie. The calories in it are not bad and the taste is great. I am always looking for a quick on the go breakfast and this hits the nail on the head. It would go amazingly with a cup of coffee. The cookie was soft and full of flavor. The only thing that I didn't love was it kind of had a salty after taste. If the sodium could be reduced just a smidgen then it would be the best cookie I have ever tasted. I would buy these if our commissary would carry them!
A1WHY5OZX7IZIG,5,"I got a free sample via influenster, I'm not gonna lie the Quaker cookie was the first thing that caught my eye. First of its was so soft & chewy its just melts in your mouth. I definetly stocked up on the cookies. I tried the oatmeal cookie & its still my fav!!"
AKS7Z4XK7O4CI,5,"I love how soft the Quaker cookies are! Not only are they soft but they're delicious too. Grab one for a snack on the go, put in your kids lunch box, or just enjoy at home. They're great!"
A3OORGROO9637C,5,I recieved this cookie via the mom vox box on [...]  and after I had it I searched the supermarket for them because they are soooo good. The cookies are moist and chewy.
A250J0FJXY8NCW,4,"Got a free sample via Influenster of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisin flavor.  First, it soft and crumbly. Secondly, it has a strong cinnamon flavor.  Thirdly, the raisins are actually good and add some texture. If you like oatmeal cookies, you will like this product."
ARH734XRHMYAF,5,"I've had other store bought cookies, these are better quality - more deluxe. I buy and bake a lot of gluten free for my son, so this was a real treat and just for me! A great snack for on the go."
A3KM691AO1IZKZ,4,"I really liked this cookie. It was very soft and chewy just how I like my cookies. The only problem was it could have been sweeter, maybe with some chocolate chips in with the raisins it would have been even better. I think for a quick breakfast great choice, not so much as a sweet though."
A15F4SZ4VFBO70,4,taste amazing and  have that home baked feel. they are so soft and chewy. perfect with a glass of ice cold milk.
A67GUC83L7J65,5,I tried the raisin oatmeal cookies and they are so soft!  I am not a raisin fan but I still loved these and think they taste homemade!
A1WRES8AAC87JN,5,I received a complimentary sample of this cookie from Quaker via Influenster's MomVoxBox. I'm not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies but when I tasted these it was really good. It's soft and delicious! I am now a fan and will be buying these for sure!
A30NTGTL97JQ3T,5,"I received a complimentary sample of this cookie from Quaker via Influenster's MomVoxBox and my husband loves Oatmeal Raisin cookies when he grabbed a hold on mine it was over he devoured it ans said this was the best Oatmeal Raisin cookie he ever tasted so I was pretty sad he didn't share so I went out the next day and purchased my unknown box and almost ate the entire box on my drive back home, they were absolutely delicious tasted so fresh and homemade like full of flavor."
AJ3Q1YCCFMMRF,5,These cookies are so good that i eat them as a snack for when i am at work and they are simply the best. Love how they are soft and taste so good.
A1X09U3KB32W7C,5,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are better than any homemade cookies I have tried or made. Which says alot considering I'm a former baker. They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies. They're especially great for on the go snacks.Also the price is very reasonable considering the quality you get. So if you're a cookie fan this one you have to try, you won't be disappointed."
AP1ZW8V4HTO6C,5,I received on in my Influenster box and loved it! So moist and chewy!  Perfect with milk and warmed in the microwave.
A15BBHB36Y8IEH,5,So tasty and Delicious you wont even think that your eating healthy ! I mean with these Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies with raisins who could resisted ?
ATN7AC0D6CUSM,5,I received a cookie from Influenster and Quaker to try in the Raisin flavor. Well this cookie was great soft and moist and the flavor was great. I will buy these for my household. I will also buy other flavors as well. Great for the family and for a travel snack.
A1R0PCZ5AY9C76,5,I had received a free sample cookie of the soft baked Quaker oatmeal cookie in raisins and my 6 yr old asked if he could have it. I told him he would have to share them with me. I was lucky I got a bite of it as he woofed that cookie down!lol It's on our next shopping list so I can get a box of my own! :)
AY4EVD29DHZQH,5,"Soft ,filling,delicious,a good for you cookie , I couldn't eat just one I had to go out and buy 2 boxes . One for me and and the next for my family to share among them selves ."
AO7G0AEWF76FZ,5,This item is super yummy!  I received this cookie in my Mom Voxbox and I couldn't have been happier.

A10AH87OLPZCAO,5,"These cookies are amazing! I got one from Influenster to review in my Mom VoxBox and my daughter loved it...  Soooo much that I bought 3 boxes at the store the next day! We have now tried the Apple Cinnamon, Oatmeal Raisin, and Banana Nut and can't decide which one we like more :)"
A2NX4G6BOQ0SZH,5,"My kids and grandkids absolutely love these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies.  I thought maybe they wouldn't like them because of the raisins, but I don't think they even noticed them as they scarfed their way through the cookies.  I was able to get in a bit or two before they got ahold of them, and I agree, very good cookies!"
AJSQYVJSZBQEZ,5,"Super perfect all my kids love them,great snack anytime of day.Quci and easy snack and not feel guilty about.Enjoy enjoy enjoy."
A31HMXJM7GZ60N,5,"Soft Cookie, if you didn't unwrap yourself you would swear your grandma baked them...my girls are not oatmeal raisin fans, but they fight over my Quaker soft baked cookies, I keep these in my cubicle, they are my go to snack, if I had a nasty client I'll pop one in my mouth and take a time out. I am a big cookie fan and I like that these are individually wrapped and will stay fresh until I need one. I original received a sample from influenster website but have since purchased them since my girls ate my original influenster provided cookie."
A2YBQ4T1BJJDE1,5,"These are wonderful. I love love love soft cookies, and oatmeal raisin are my favorite! I mostly make my own cookies, but I would definitely purchase these! I got them compliments of Influenster & Quaker to test out, and my son & I love them!"

A6EE2QHQ92AM1,5,I have never been a huge fan of oatmeal cookies but I would have to say these are very delicious! Just the right amount of raisins & they have a very nice texture. I would buy these again!
A2DAE4L0OCQO6W,5,My family loves these cookies. Every time we go to the store we need to pick up a box! The cookies are really soft and fall apart so easily.
A25X6XGD2RUE3C,5,"Quaker brand oatmeal cookies are the most delicious cookies!  They are moist and soft and the raisins are plump and just the right size. If you want a good ""home-baked"" taste in a cookie, these are the ones to get!"
A1KC31GANHZ0W2,4,"Quaker Breakfast Cookies Oatmeal Raisin, 6-Count Boxes,10.1-Ounces  (Pack of 6)]]s.  They come in individually wrapped packages so you could use them as snacks for school, if you wish.  They are very soft and chewy and filled with a lot of raisins.  Very Tasty!  Kids will love them!"

A2N0EWFLEDIYOZ,5,"This is an amazing cookie! I thought it was going to be gross but once I took a bite I was amazed! Please try it, you won't regret it!"
AWQXNZA48CEKD,5,I received this cookie from Influenster for testing purposes. As soon as I took it out of the box it was GONE! Can you say DELICIOUS! Me and my son both ate half. It has the best homemade taste. I love how it's super soft and just crumbles in your mouth and melts. BEST cookie ever!
A1M7HDF51QX1KG,5,I received this product from influenster and i loved the oatmeal cookie type! They are perfect on the go and i just HAD to buy a box at the store when i saw them. They were gone in 2 DAYS!!! They are perfect for that sweet late night snack and even as a on the run breakfast! 5 stars!
A19SHIMZDF8YUW,5,The size of the cookie was great and filling especially for a quick snack for a busy mom or even your children. I will buy this again for sure!
A1NNTRF2NMJS6C,5,"So these are amazing - I am usually not a Oatmeal Raisin lover... EVER, but these were surprisingly good ! Thanks for making me a lover !"
A1HHXN6OJS6ADQ,5,Great cookie!  Soft and moist!  Will def purchase these again :)<br />I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.
A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,5,"This product was very moist and had the perfect texture. I loved it. It was chewy and soft too. After my first cookie, I wanted another one really bad. I plan on definitely buying more."
A1IMGSJYMW0PYN,5,"This cookie only lasted a few mins in my house. I my son ate most of it but I did get a couple bits of it & it was so soft, which is how I love my cookies, it was also very moist and nice & chewy. I will defiantly be buying these again."
A2JRXXDPAI9CK9,5,This is and amazing cookie! I received the Raisin cookie to try through influenster and was pleasantly surprised by its taste and texture. It truly is a very soft cookie and has a bold taste. Me and my two year old devoured this cookie then whet out to buy more! Would defiantly recommend.
A1VIO3SYZR3XQK,5,I really like these cookies. I am not a huge fan of raisins but these are so good. Nice and soft!
A3FXFTS06IX22M,5,These are awesome cookies! Nice and soft! Love!!! They great to give your kids for a snack or to take to work for a snack
A1KWXTO4HNXM3F,5,I loved these cookies! they have great flavor and taste! I loved them! They are great snacks for afterschool or a nice add on to any lunch. they come perpackaged so they do not dry out.
AH5Y2L3K51J0O,3,"I love chewy cookies! And these are definitely chewy. I love it. But the downside is that it's made in a place that manufactures peanuts. My Bubs is allergic to peanuts. =\ So, he couldn't have any."
A1I3EENJGC14MT,5,"I received this cookie courtesy of influenster, my family loves oatmeal cookies, and this one was awesome!! My son and I shared it, very soft and full of moist raisins! Will for sure look for these in the store! Can't wait to try others!"
A1MTVA7JWWXVZ,5,"I received a sample of these cookies through Influenster.It was gone within a minute of receiving the package.I didn't even share it,all mine lol.They are super soft and delicious!They taste like I just baked them myself.I have never tasted such an amazing cookie,for real!"
A2UOLY21GNTI74,3,"I received this sample of Quaker Soft Baked Cookie via Influenster to try. My husband grabbed it up quickly, He liked the taste but says the texture could be better it seemed to crumble very easily."
A1A0QSOZKJ9CSW,5,these are very good. i didnt think they would be as moist as they were but they were melt in the mouth good :)
A2B3VA81IGPLZA,4,These are really good. My husband and daughter fought over them!!  They are so soft and chewy and they taste like cinnamon.
A20ND5VKGAG7XA,5,"This is the perfect pick-me-up snack.  Great flavor and perfectly filling.  I quickly regretted sharing with my husband.  This snack is great for the entire family, and knowing we're making a healthier choice is a good feeling."
A19ABDKY8ULUN5,5,"I received a sample courtesy Influenster, well... I didn't have the pleasure to taste it myself, because my son got ahold of it and started munching away!!  He absolutely loved this cookie :)  And that's saying alot, since my son can not stand raisins, period!  I guess I'm gonna have to add this one to my grocery list :)"
A2GAR6CBJTSSI7,5,"I got a Quaker cookie to try in my Voxbox from Influenster. I gave it to my 8 year old son, who normally hates anything with raisins or anything remotely healthy, He loved it. Thanks Quaker for getting my child to eat something different."
A3JVAMHQ1AG1HE,5,"I received this cookie compliments of Quaker via Influenster to try. My son ate it so quick. I love Quaker and will be looking for these on our next grocery trip! My boy said it was delicious! We already buy the chewy oatmeal bars, adding these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies to our list of Quaket products!"
A2L6V7O69GKNBH,4,"I received the Raisin flavored from Influenster complimentary for tasting.  It was very good to me, not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies. The fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better.  I am going to buy the cranberry & yogurt next."
AYFFC113F808A,5,I love the home baked mom taste these have! Just like my mom made them! They are also easy to find and affordable!
A13VH0PS4SKVDF,5,"I rec'd this product from influenster and Quaker for testing purposes. I've always enjoyed Quaker oats from the hot oatmeal, down to the cookie itself. Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie is made with whole grain Quaker oats, At least 10 grams of whole grains per serving.<br />Made with real fruit, Good source of fiber, delicious. Quaker oats been around since over a hundred years."
A38WFD1V0SDN3Y,5,I received one of these awesome cookies from Influenster! They are DELICIOUS!! Super soft and moist...tasted home made! :) Yummy!
A3B8CXU4T1X7S8,4,These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins. This is only because I hate raisins. So if you like raisins then you would probably like them. I probably wouldn't repurchase this for myself because I would rather make homemade without them. I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins.
A3VQXWRIB7GV3F,5,"Soft, chewy and just like Grandma used to make. I can't wait until I eat the next cookie as these are something to savor and enjoy!"
AXMQG5G02SA4G,4,"From Influenster I received the Quaker Soft Baked Cookie. With this product, after dinner one night, I divided it up into 3 equal portions. One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our 1 1/2 year old daughter.<br />Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.<br /><br />I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first."
A2O6305QOF45MQ,5,My whole family absolutely loves these cookies...so soft and yummy!  And I like the fact that they are a nutritious treat for the kids...a much better option than candy or soda.
AY3PYPIHPZQ25,5,I loved how soft and delicious these cookies are! They are the new everyday snack in my house! Must have!
A1M7JSSMOWMMKP,5,I love the way these cookies taste just like homemade cookies. They are easy to take and eat on the go.
A32SIZL5NVDXJM,5,"I thought that I might have had tried some of the tastiest oatmeal cookis before, but that wasn't so until I recently tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies . These cookies are so delicious. They taste just like homeade cookies. They are soft , full of raisins, and are just fabulous.I bought a box at my locl Walmart the other day for $2.18 for eight cookies. These are a good size cookie too. Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from Quaker I can't wait to try out the different varieties that Quaker carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks Quaker!! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box! They were A+++."
AKXTFI6OGWJQF,5,I love this soft bake cookie I recived from Quaker!<br />I enjoyed the Nutritious soft baked cookie and I plan to buy more for my family! great taste and Price!1
AYA1ON1SVIPJU,5,"The oatmeal raisin is the cookie that I've tried. I love it as well as my daughter. It's soft and tastes amazing. Not to mention cheap, I'll be buying more."
A3PQXK6DVMK7FC,5,"I really enjoyed the goodness of Quaker Oatmeal combined with soft, plump and juicy raisins in a soft cookie. It is an irrisistable snack for the entire family and leaves you feeling full and satisfied."
A3UHYHNR917I0V,5,These cookies are so delicious.. I received one in my influenster mom voxbox and just had to repurchase.. So soft and chewy..def a must buy..happy customer over here..good job quaker
AELE6F4ST9DS9,5,"I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail."
A1QBOC76MIOJYP,3,"These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more ""oatmealy"" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it."
AXOO7BPM22BDO,5,"Came as an 8-pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about 1/4 inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!"
A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,3,"Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly."
A96K1ZGW56S2I,4,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack."
ANEDXRFDZDL18,3,"Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with Quaker Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches."
A19XE6G6NDZFPS,2,"I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!"
A3R9H6OKZHHRJD,3,"As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again."
A1ZZR25X0CNOJX,3,"I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up."
AYPEPA3VS4KDM,3,"I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled ""oatmeal"" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible."
AGKW1Q9IUWIMT,3,"If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over."
A1MKFNZSI1EISM,5,"I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job, Quaker :)<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox."
AQ9S2GTR0VDC2,4,I received this cookie to test from Influenster.  I had the raisin cookie and it was really so good!  I like that they use whole grains to make the cookie.  Breakfast really isn't my favorite meal of the day and I like something that is fast and easy.  This cookie is a good breakfast option for me.  I'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  The cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.  I really liked it and will be buying more!
A3CC3H75JBUM5F,4,"I love how these Quaker soft baked cookies taste. I love them warmed up or cold, either way they are quick and easy to eat on the go."
A3O2Q9T0NP8GJ2,5,I really enjoyed the Quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie.  It's true...it tastes homemade!  Great for on the go when you need a treat or even for the kid's lunch boxes.
A2IOZ5M5I2OEYQ,5,Cookies are soft and so good! Taste just like a regular cookie! I received cookie complimentary from influenster in my mombox and was delighted with how good it was.
A22DU4GYKA83J2,5,These new Quaker Oat Soft Baked Cookies are amazing! Soft and chewy. Very fresh and like they were just baked the day you bought them. My kids love them and it's a great way to give them their whole gains with a small serving of fruit. They are also great to pack in for a snack or a low calorie desert at 170 calories per cookie! I love these and will continue to purchase!
A10JVTCCFCSLA1,4,"OMG....these are so good, better than I thought, they actually do taste home made, and I gotta say they taste even better than my grandmothers, sorry grams...:) I will definetly try these again, I got lucky and got to try a delicious sample from the influenster team :) I love quaker, and influenster.com"
A1MBC8A72OKKB2,5,I recieved this cookie FREE FROM INFLUENSTER.COM in their MOM VOXBOX 2012 THEME PRODUCT TESTING. and omg i loved it. it was soft and didnt taste so filling. it was light and great flavor tasting  i loved it
A2B1KYYE9GLXT,4,Cookie is great and tasty. Tastes fresh. Very large in comparison to others related to the category. Very yummy. Will buy again.
ADAZ4T3AAHVN7,5,"I received a sample of this product for free to test from Influenster and Quaker.  The cookie did not last long and I ended up going out to buy a whole new box.<br /><br />My son is three and he said the cookie tasted ""kind of like a muffin"" and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day.  The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for 10 seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren't individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  They are pretty great!  Oh, and they're not bad nutritionally... so go ahead and eat one for breakfast... I won't tell."
A2W44462BFUFXC,5,"These are the best oatmeal cookies ever! They're so soft and yummy. My whole family loves them,and I have a pretty picky family."
A2TTY3BVKVYGH9,5,"I love these cookies! They are so soft and my daughter eats them without any problems.I am a big oatmeal cookie fan, but quakers are the best brand so far."
ALD9AADGX1SF1,5,This cookie was the bomb. It falls apart in your mouth...tastes fresh like grandma just brought it to you out of the oven! LOvvvee em!
A3VH1WBN26YPD4,5,I tried the Oatmeal Raisin cookie and it was delicious.  The cookie is fairly big which is great.  It is soft and chewy so you don't have to worry about crumbs getting all over the place if your on the go.  I have already bought more!
A3RZ6V984Z309M,5,"Well, if you ask my son, he might tell you it's better than his mommy's homemade oatmeal raisin cookies. :/ He loves the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and says they are ""Soft, chewy and Yummy!"" I'll be buying more!"
A1ZP6TKMFXZNNA,4,"I Tried these after receiving a free sample from influencer.com, and they were delicious. Soft and chewy, with the perfect amount of raisins. They're a great size too. I will definitely buy some when they're available on amazon. My toddler loves them too."
A351NTWO6OD00Y,4,I found these cookies really moist and yummy. Good size and perfect for a snack break or for breakfast. My girls really liked them too. They remind of home made cookies. Good way to snack healthy.
A1LO8G0GFC4KIL,5,Loved my Quaker cookie it taste really good and is very soft unlike them other hard cookies. I could eat a whole box of these. Yes they taste that good
A182XF8JTD70TF,5,I really loved this cookie. It was soft and a bit chewy. I think that if I had not read the box I would not think they are good for you. Definitley a treat worth trying. I was totally satisfied and wished more came in a box!
A2NAHH0ZHQYQOC,5,I received this product in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. I have tried other Quaker products and loved them. These were just as good as the rest. I love how soft and chewy this oatmeal cookie was. The raisins were nice and juicy as well. I can't wait to grab a bigger size box or bag or whatever they may come in. It is well worth it.
A30E27O1GM3GLV,5,"I receive those cookies for review i love the flavor and all of it, i recommend 100%, my family love too, thanks quaker oatmeal cookier you are part of my family now!"
A3FY73C23XQ35E,5,These cookies are so good an soft. When i had my wisdom teeth out after they healed I could not eat anything hard for a while an these cookies were so helpful even kids love them an there easy for on the go
A1CCZ00L3XLLM8,4,"I was able to try this product through Influenster in my Mom Voxbox.  I had to share it with my 2 year old daughter since you can't eat cookies in front of kids lol!  It was delicious and soft baked, just like home made cookies.  My only complaint is that my cookie didn't have a good amount of raisins in it.  Maybe I just got a batch that missed a few extra raisins but I definitely felt that it could've used more.  Other than that, it was a great snack, especially to serve to kids!!  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)"
A2HTC5PWUGOO88,5,I am so surprised these are healthy because they taste so darn good. They are packed with flavors and the best party- they are deliciously chewy! I will be buying these immediately my next trip to the grocery store. My three year old loved it!
A2T2UZT6ZIKJK9,5,I received this sample in my Influenster MOMVOXBOX and I must say I wish I had gotten more than just one cookie.  It was delicious.  Shared it with my husband and he liked equally as well.  Very moist and flavorful.
AXI9UTOJIO2T2,5,I really enjoy Quaker oats in the mornings. The best part of my morning is sitting down to a nice hot bowl.
A2001065G65VJW,5,"I was able to enjoy this cookie because I received it in my VoxBox from Influenster. This cookie definitely does not skimp on any qualities a cookie should have. It was soft, chewy, fresh tasting and delicious. It is perfect for a quick breakfast or a quick snack or a yummy dessert with some ice cream. I will definitely be purchasing this item more often!"
A1SWR7XGG9RF5T,5,"I received the chocolate and almond Quaker oatmeal cookie free to try from #influenster in my #MomVoxBox, my 11 month old LOVED it!! She couldn't get enough of it, and it was soft enough that I didn't have to worry about her choking on it :) That's always a plus, I had to go out and buy more  so swhe could eat them!!"
A3JYLJBS0B2BK0,5,"I got this sample from influenster and I loved it. It was soft, not too sweet and the texture and taste were perfect."
A102EES14OUWJ6,5,I received this cookie in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. My kids and I shared the cookie and we all enjoyed it.  I will buy more and try all the different flavors.
A206CPY61AHCP0,5,"I didn't even know these existed until I received them in my Mom Voxbox from Influenster. Luckily only one of my children was with me when I opened it. We shared the Oatmeal Raisin cookie, and we both thought it was wonderful! So much so, that I went out and found them at our grocery store. Try them warmed! Nice size, and very soft and chewy. So yummy!! I really would like to try the different flavors as well. A very tasty product!!"
A1TW7JS5YUJZ0H,5,"I loved these cookies so much, they where nice and soft which I love in a cookie. They did not skimp on any flavor at all, I would buy these again and again."
A2LPFAQMVYNZ4L,5,my kids love the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie. i was amazed they love a healthier cookie. i love it because its a healthy alternative and its made out of oatmeal.
AC46E8KPBMRG9,4,I was able to try this product because Influenster sent it to me in their #MomVoxBox for testing. Honestly I wasn't able to try it personally because my kids snatched it from me ha ha! But they enjoyed it a lot. They asked me if I would buy more and in different flavors too. Good and hearty snack for kids indeed! Thanks!
A3TO4GZ35YKK1X,5,"Oatmeal and raisins are healthy, right? Put them in cookie form and I've tricked my little toddler into a healthy snack that she thinks is a treat. These were really soft and flavorful. Definitely would buy again."
A11ZFH7I1YJ5ZF,5,"This is my first time trying this cookie. Its very soft, delicious, love the raisins. I will be buying theses for a snack for breakfast. I told all my friends to try this product."

A359GKKXONNTE0,5,"These cookies are absolutely amazing. My three year doesnt like a lot of snacks and cookies and hes very picky, but he likes a couple of these flavors. They are very soft and very delicious and extremely tasty, you almost forget that they are healthy for you. I absolutely love quaker oatmeal and these cookies are an extra treat."
A309MKE7Y0OCEX,4,"From a he said she said point of view...<br /><br />He: (Who likes soft cookies) Thought they were good, chewy,  moist and delicious.<br /><br />She: (Who prefers a more crunchy cookie) I liked it but I wasn't crazy about it, taste was okay you could tell you were eating a whole grain cookie. The raisins saved this cookie for me.<br /><br />Over all we like Quaker Oats, we would buy this cookie if we has a coupon but not as a number one on our list."
A3CPL126VL12H8,5,"I was excited to receive a package of Quaker Soft Baked Cookies through Influenster to try out.  I was surprised at how reasonable the ingredients were and how low in fat the single serve package was.  The cookie itself tasted fresh, soft and delicious.  I would definitely buy these for myself as a little treat and for the family.  Try them for yourself!"
A2VIXDY3AW8GSY,5,my daughter who is almost 2 devoured  the cookie.. i only got to get a little piece that she didnt want at the end but omg i put it on my grocery list for this week i cant wait to eat more more more

A1JBOM5L972U4P,5,"I was choosen as one of @Influensters Mom VoxBox recipients. I was excited about that, but I was even more excited when I opened it to see that there was a Quaker Oatmeal soft baked cookie inside. I immediately opened it. It's one of the softest and most delicious cookies I have had in a long time. I immediately had two of my kids try a piece of it also. They loved it also! These cookies are rich in flavor, not dry, and all around a great cookie. I went out yesterday and bought two more boxes of them. These are a great product to keep handy for snack time! Absolutely love them!"
ANEIQUS6I8RJ5,4,This cookie is good the only thing I had a problem with is that it's soft. Duh I know it says soft baked I'm so used to eating the hard oatmeal raisin cookie. I will purchase this in the future and will recommend.

A6EZNISAV5HDW,5,I really enjoy these cookies -- and so do my kids!  They will be perfect for lunch box snacks or a yummy treat for after school.

A2PFXN5DD378ZH,5,"My son and I both loved Quaker's Soft Baked cookies! I received a sample in the Mom VoxBox via Influenster. I've never been a fan of the hard type cookies so I loved how soft and chewy these ones were. Since my son is still a toddler, I think they were soft enough for him and his little teeth to chew and eat. Plus they were just plain delicious!"
A3VQA04J03WR5W,5,I received this product from influenster in my mom voxbox 2012 to test out. My grab grabbed the cookie of the box and hid...he has been begging me for more ever since. Unfortunately they don't sell them in m local grocery store yet but next time I go out of town I plan on purchasing more!!!
A248UQ9YXAMO9Z,5,yummy great cookie just like my momma makes this is deffinietely a second best of course after my moms cooking love how soft and chewy they are a must buy
A3IMUU0I31XF33,5,yummy great cookie just like my momma makes this is deffinietely a second best of course after my moms cooking love how soft and chewy they are a must buy
AR59MPG3N1TZY,5,I recieved this product for free to test from Influenster for promotional reasons. Me and my daughters ages 4 and 7 all tried the cookie and we loved it. It taste great and it really is soft. My local store didnt have The Quaker SOft baked oatmeal raisin cookie so I bought the breakfast version of it and I love it as well. The cookies are great for all ages!!! I would recommend this cookie to people.
A2SYFD082MMP1I,5,"I was selected by Influenster to get a mom Voxbox.  Inside with other products I got a full size sample of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies.  My daughter was so happy with it.  I was able to steal a small amount from her...It was so yummy and soft.  It was a nice size too. It was not small at all and you will get your moneys worth.  The fact that it has oatmeal is a plus, meaning my kids are putting something healthy in them when they are snacking.  I will definetely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone.  If you want a yummy soft cookie with lots of flavor with none of the work and clean up after baking...go get a box of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies...you won't be sorry. :-) I know my kids are happy that I tryed it....Thanks again Influenster and Quaker."
A7I7SJY5XH198,4,I recieved one as a sample but I will now be buying these cookies from now on! Oh and the kids also loved them!
A1WRODKCJAYZY0,5,"I got one package (one cookie) in my Mom VoxBox. I only got one bite because my husband Ate the rest, He Loved it!!!! A+++"
AVHYBNHMM37DF,5,"Influenster sent me a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test out and review in the Mom voxbox! WOW!! SO GOOD! And it really is so soft, if feels and tastes fresh baked. I only have one question, what took them so long to make these?? =) Really they are so good you wonder why they haven't thought of this years ago!<br />Here are a few of the details! They are individually packaged, so they are great for on the go! They are made with yummy whole grain Quaker oats! They are a good source of fiber and only have 6 grams of total fat per serving! I know you are dying to know where you can get these now! You can buy them at pretty much any major retailers and have a suggested retail of $2.69 for 6 cookies, That's less than $0.50 a cookie! Great deal! Give them a try and let me know how you like tem!"
A17NJIDEUGN7BK,5,"I love all of Quaker's products and so I didn't expect anything less from these cookies. I was not disappointed. The cookies are soft, chewy, and filling. They have the right amount of cinnamon and rasins in them. My kids even like them which is hard when it comes to oatmeal. I would definitely recommend these cookies if you love oatmeal rasin cookies."
ANTT3Y4ARSRTO,5,"I already loved Quaker products, I grew up on them. This did not disappoint. Its a soft cookie, its a fulfilling treat and it has fiber :)"
A575HZ0LJVLB4,5,"I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster via the mom vox box campaign to try and review, and i love this product!! Its soft, tasty, healthy, and its mom approved!!

A37KHYLLDLUH8W,5,"I rcvd this complimentary through Influenster.com & they are amazing! Moist, tender w/ that small slight crunch from the oats. The flavor was a great blend with none to overpowering! Can't wait to try the other flavors!"
A14H8RRZX87VZM,5,"I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster to try-then immediately went out and bought 2 more boxes, which are now gone also. These cookies have such a great homebaked consistency and just the right amount of spice and sugar. My kids love them too, especially when we cut them in half and put a little ice cream between the halves."
A1HXFAZ5GOHDSE,5,I received this from influenster in my mom voxbox omg i love the cookie i got only one sample i when to buy 4 more box's my family love's it thanks Influenster and Quaker!
A16WIPH6PUI5XY,5,"I was not sure what to think about this product when it first came out because really its one more cookie and could it really be soft.  Well, Quaker delivered!  I love these cookies, they are great for any time including breakfast."
A2WG21234BLBS9,5,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins is very good. Nice and soft. Easy to break into smaller pieces to eat. Highly recommend trying this product."
A2ZUVZO1CQIEIA,5,My whole family enjoyed the yummy goodness of Quaker oatmeal cookies with raisins. My 3 year old couldn't get enough of them. It reminded me of my grandma's home made cookies. The taste brought me back to my childhood when I would help my grandma bake. So soft and I could taste the wholesome goodness in each bite. I will be buying more soon!
A27TITC8ON9CMZ,5,I received this from influenster in my mom voxbox and my kids loved this cookie. I didn't even get a chance to try it and had to purchase a box. I highly recommend this cookie... Its a great snack and a healthier one!!!!
A2VMH7YBP3YUTV,5,The Quaker Brand soft cookies are so good! They are yummy and soft and really fill you up! So easy on the go with the kids or if your just relaxing at home with some milk!
AD8FQNZ6BV2K2,5,"These are so yummy,my son loves them. As a mother I feel good about giving this to my son for a snack"
A3A6ALK2YTTCZS,5,"I recieved them in my influenster mom voxbox, and before I can try it my kids ate it!. They loved them, they have been asking me to go to the store and get some more. Looks like tomorrow I'm going shopping."
A3QS9QL6DOKQDW,5,"I didn't get a chance to eat this cookie, but my 5 year old absolutely loved it.  She said that is was very yummy, soft and good.  She wanted more.  I told that we would get more..."
A3BD20DGXAO0XN,5,"These cookies are delicious! So soft and flavorful. My fave! My first time trying these cookies was a couple of weeks ago, and I will defiantly recommend."
ASL2HC6CORCL4,5,"Such a tasty cookie... soft, flavorful.  Mmm.<br /><br />I was highly surprised at how good these were.  Yum!  The portion was quite generous, making for a nice afternoon snack."
A26QSJ79DIG4UA,3,My kids really like to eat the quaker oatmeal soft cookies in the morning<br /> for breakfest with a big glass of milk! :)
A1QN2KOLKLWEI5,4,"My whole family loved this cookie! It is very soft and tastes great! It was so soft that my 8 month old even got to enjoy it, too!"
AHLTM0DX828V6,4,"The cookie is soft and flavorful. It tastes good and the raisins are moist. My only complaint is the the cookie didn't stay together. It breaks apart very easily,"
A186RQLMYP1VNG,5,I really loved the taste of these cookies. They tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies. They seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies. I used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind. I would definitely buy these again.
A11FWFOKGGAUYA,5,"i like to buy them for my kids they love them and theyre also good for them, they are soft and chewy healthy and the taste is great"
A2ELXIIB38YHUO,5,These cookies are amazing! Great for snacks for the children. Nutritious yet satisfying. Will keep purchasing more of these. Amazing great taste.
A3CKZNWP2ILJP,5,"What a great snack for on the run, in a purse or diaper bag, or even for a quick treat at home! Was delicious and pretty healthy compared to some cookies!"
A1C826V9XWNTEQ,5,"We tried the soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies and fell in love with them! Being a mom and constantly on the go its hard to find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag, purse, lunch box or car. I would recommend these to every one:)"
A304933U8Y14R4,5,I shared these with my toddler. We both loved them. They are soft and practically melt in your mouth. They are so soft and delicious. The fact that they are healthy also helps and makes me feel great about giving them to my kids.
A3984G9B5FXH64,5,"As Soon as I received my sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox from influenster.com my 2 yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why. They taste very fresh and everyone loves them!<br />I got to try this product for free in my MomVoxBox from Influenster.com<br />I'm an Influenster and Influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!"
A1N5FSCYN4796F,2,"Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies."
A100WO06OQR8BQ,3,"I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with."
A96AUNSF6GESO,3,"I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,4,"When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from Quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+"
A36K2N527TXXJN,4,"I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings."
AYNAH993VDECT,1,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?"
A37LNXZ3U8Z0PW,2,Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.
A31TS9SW3D9O7S,5,I must admit this was one great product. Not only did I enjoy these my son's did as well . They were a big hit today at my sons birthday party and I intend to keep purchasing!! Great job!
A1KNMUQUT0E467,5,I receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious I have never tried these but I would recommend them to anyone
A2I60HCAVEF3RC,5,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:14 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway."
AKGD6454LHII6,5,"I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!"
A1N8YKDJ8KJAMM,5,"I loved this cookie! I received it in my mom vox box from influenster, and that was the first thing me and my daughter tried. (: She absolutely loved it, and I will be buying more and put them in my diaper bag, for on the go trips (:"
A1XVIFTPEMLD62,5,"Hello, I received this cookie in my @influenster Mom VoxBox to review and i have to say i was very pleased with the taste, texture and the enormous size of the cookie. I am happy with Quaker Products, i always have been ever since i was little. I now pass the nutritional products to my children as my grandma passed it on to me."
A2BEW6FNOW66XX,5,"I like the cookies while on the go.  They are soft and chewy and have the goodness of Quaker products.  If you don't have time to bake, then give these cookies a try.  They taste great.  I sampled the product thanks to Influenster and I am so thankful for that!"
A14WF67CUR3SUJ,5,i recived a free sample from Influenster and let me tell you it was so good and soft it crumbles up right in your mouth and its a big cookie my daughter also loved it i would difenitly recommend buying it if you like oatmeal and raisins
A2XYCTVMA6HMM0,5,"These cookies are a great quick snack for the kids. They did not even complain about the raisins, I think they gobble them up before they even notice!"
A2ND5PJ38SLVPV,5,"I received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box. These are super soft cookies that are individually wrapped for convenience. The individually wrapped cookie is a huge feature here as the cookies stay fresh and soft in a easily tote-able package. You get the great taste of Quaker oat cookies without the work of baking them! Toss in the kids lunch bag, spouse lunch box, pack for a picnic, use in birthday party favor bags for a healthy alternative! Great tasting, great portability, great texture. love them!!"
A34Y157GY4DWJ7,5,My children love these cookies. They are very soft and taste awesome. Will be buying more for sure.The best cookies we ever tried.

A1YTINX5QKEW3P,5,I have fallen in love with Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie! I tried them in my mom voxbox from Influenster and it was so good. It tasted like a homemade cookie to me. I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the Quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend Quaker.
A392CEKYCUK725,5,i love these soft cookies. they taste like fresh baked out of the oven. the oatmeal is very sweet and tasty
A1G5DIQMDBP8UA,5,I absolutely loved these new cookies. They were so soft and yummy. The kids also enjoyed them. I saw them in the store also and they price wasn't bad. I'll be a returning customer for these.
A2UI2YR1T3P1ZI,5,"I received this amazing Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom VoxBox. I'm normally not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies since I don't like raisins, but this was delicious! The cookie was thick and tasted homemade with a nice oatmeal flavor. I'm definitely going to buy more of these."
A95PKRD4T3RUG,3,"I got this from Influenster in my mom voxbox,  it was very soft and tasty my husband said, as he was the one who ate it lol!"
A1QA81DFWWGPPN,4,"I got these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, and they were really good. They were moist and yummy. I don't like raisins so I picked them out, but the oatmeal was amazing. I will definitely buy some more. Well, a flavor without raisins in them."
A28LXPTCISZA0S,5,"I got one of these in my Influenster Mom VoxBox! OMG they were so good, My daughter and I shared the first one then i went and got another box! This are a must have now! They are great to snack on. They are super soft. There is nothing bad to say about these cookies. You must try them!"
A2PAJUZF2RCZIW,4,"A decadent go to treat!! Nice to keep around the house for quick meals, toss them in homemade ice cream for a yummy flavor or just grab one when you have a sweet tooth!"
AES9VNGFZLOE1,5,"~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take ""on-the-go"" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains 6 grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain Quaker Oats! You can't beat that! Try them out, I'm sure you'll love them as much as I did! =D"
A22QAN7HTA6R7L,5,The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.
A284GGIIM31PGM,1,"My kids or I didn't care for it much, they tossed it after a few bites, and what kids throw away cookies????"
A1A1BM6N28X9J0,1,"If I could give it zero stars I would......horrible taste and not much of that either. Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives Quaker a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment...."
A55PK06Q6AKFY,4,"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others."
A1YJMG0QJXZLD4,5,"I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again."
A1W0EK0033YVGP,5,"this cookie is super soft and chewy.i love it and also try their oatmeal cookies,they are the bomb diggitty!!!i would recommend this to everyone.i received this in my mom voxbox and my kids loved it!!"
AFJFINIKFOFSB,3,"These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is 170 calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one."
AQUMNB8YWE595,5,THIS IS A FAB PRODUCT SOFT AND CHEWY YOU CANT GO WRONG ME AND MY KIDS LOVE THEM MY TWO YEAR OLD IS HARD FOR HIM TO SHARE HE SAYS NO MY COOKIE LOL
A366PSH7KFLRPB,5,"I loved these cookies and so did my kids. You can read my full review here [...] My favorite part was definitely the taste, and I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan."
A2KV6EYQPKJRR5,5,This is a great tasting cookie. It is very soft and the texture is very smooth. I usually do not like oatmeal cookies because the texture is very gritty and tough. This cookie does not have that problem. It tastes like your Mom just made it.
A3O7REI0OSV89M,4,"These are great for a quick snack! They are satisfying even if you have a sweet tooth. I love that they are whole grain and have fiber! Delicious, just wish there weren't raisins in them!"
A9JS5GQQ6GIQT,5,"I love the Quaker soft baked cookies.  The really are soft and taste great.  I tried the oatmeal raisin, and cant wait to try the other flavors.  They all look really good."
AMAVEZAGCH52H,5,This cookie is really good and works really well for my family.  In the morning it fits in to my morning routine.  I take the cookie put it in the microwave and out the door we go with my tea.  Something I can eat at my desk or on the run.  It holds me over till lunch and is not too heavy.

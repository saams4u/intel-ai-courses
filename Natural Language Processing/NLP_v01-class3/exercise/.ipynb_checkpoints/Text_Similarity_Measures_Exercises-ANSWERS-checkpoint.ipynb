They're not doing that, no actors.  \\nJohn: It's all changed, now.  \\nBrian: But this is what I wonder. In those days, the actors used to say their\\nbest bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?  \\nJohn: No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film. You should have seen\\nthe rest.  \\nBrian: Yes?  \\nJohn: Rubbish!  \\nBrian: Was it, really?  \\nJohn: Even worse, yes.  \\nBrian: Who was worst?  \\nJohn: Oh, Paul.  \\nBrian: I see.  \\nPaul: I think John was about the worst.  \\nJohn: No, it was you.  \\nPaul: Oh, Ringo was very good. He was. He's a good lad.  \\nBrian: He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin. Do you think that's\\nright?  \\nJohn: He was miming.  \\nPaul: You, too, with Jason.  \\nJohn: Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?  \\nBrian: Beginning to look like that.

I hope not!  \\nJohn: We brought you the flowers, Ring.  \\nBrian: He's not allowed to talk.  \\nRingo: Eh?  \\nJohn: We brought you the flowers.  \\nRingo: Oh, good.  \\nJohn: And the grapes.  \\nRingo: Oh, I like grapes.  \\nPaul: He likes grapes.  \\nGeorge: We've been to Portugal.  \\nBrian: Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.  \\nAll: Who?  \\nBrian: Los Beatles.  \\nJohn: Los Beatles? Great, great laugh.  \\nBrian: I don't suppose you know the title of your film in Portuguese?  \\nJohn: No. Crinsk dee Night?  \\nBrian: Could be.

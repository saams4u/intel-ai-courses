**Summary**
This course provides an overview of machine learning fundamentals on modern IntelÂ® architecture. Topics covered include:

- Reviewing the types of problems that can be solved
- Understanding building blocks
- Learning the fundamentals of building models in machine learning
- Exploring key algorithms

By the end of this course, students will have practical knowledge of:

- Supervised learning algorithms
- Key concepts like under- and over-fitting, regularization, and cross-validation
- How to identify the type of problem to be solved, choose the right algorithm, tune parameters, and validate a model
- The course is structured around 12 weeks of lectures and exercises. Each week requires three hours to complete. The exercises are implemented in Python*, so familiarity with the language is encouraged (you can learn along the way).

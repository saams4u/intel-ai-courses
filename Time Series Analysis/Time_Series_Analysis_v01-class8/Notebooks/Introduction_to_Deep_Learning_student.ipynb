    "In previous lessons, we've gone from learning the basic components of time series to employing advanced signal transformation techniques. As the culmination of these lessons, we'll now turn toward deep learning as a method for time series forecasting. We'll see how **recurrent neural networks** can automatically learn how to model series components like seasonality and autocorrelation without special preprocessing. In the process, we'll gain exposure to the python library **Keras**, which provides an excellent interface for constructing neural networks. \n",

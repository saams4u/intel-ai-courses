Having a firm grasp of this concept will lay the foundation necessary to understand more advanced modeling strategies that we'll introduce in subsequent lessons. Spend the time to really understand this material.\n",

    "### What is Stationarity?\n",
    "In order for time series data to be stationary, the data must exhibit four properties over time:\n",
    "1. constant mean\n",
    "2. constant variance\n",
    "3. constant autocorrelation structure\n",
    "4. no periodic component\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean, variance, and periodic component (aka seasonality) should be familiar to you. Autocorrelation may not be. Autocorrelation simply means that the current time series measurement is correlated with a past measurement. For example, today's stock price is often highly correlated with yesterday's price. \n",
    "\n",
    "To discuss these things simply we must introduce the idea of a **lag**. Lag is a fancy term for delay. Say you wanted to know if today's stock price correlated better with yesterday's price or the price from two days ago. You could test this by computing the correlation between the original time series and the same series delayed one time interval. Therefore, the second value of the original time series would be compared with the first of the delayed. The third original value would be compared with the second of the delayed. And so on. Performing this process for a lag of 1 and a lag of 2, respectively, would yield two correlation outputs. This output would tell you which lag is more correlated. That is **autocorrelation** in a nutshell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply what we've learned now that we nailed down terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by creating a variable called **time** that will define equally-spaced time intervals. Then we'll sample values from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Essentially we're creating noise, which is a stationary time series. In other words, the series of data exhibits all four proporties required of a stationary time series."

    "In Lesson 6, *Kalman Filters*, we learned that a Kalman filter (KF) is a way to estimate the value of a signal in the presence of noise. We discussed how the it works conceptually and then described how the filter operates for two one-dimensional examples (static and dynamic). We concluded with a presentation of the equations that describe the general Kalman filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue our discussion by implementing the recursive algorithm of the Kalman filter for the static and dynamic one-dimensional systems.  These two examples will lay the foundation to understand our third example with state vectors in higher dimension.

    "In this lesson, we will use the Kalman filter to estimate the value of a signal from noisy data. Initially, we will construct the algorithm by hand so we understand all the steps involved. Also, we will generate datasets from scratch so we know what our true result should be and therefore gain insight into how well the Kalman Filter works. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the lecture, this is workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Make an initial estimate of your state vector and covariance matrix\n",
    "    - Predict the state and covariance for the next time step\n",
    "    - Computer the Kalman gain\n",
    "    - Make a measurement\n",
    "    - Update estimates of state and covariance \n",
    "    - Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "For our one-dimensional examples, there are a couple of simplifications: the state vector is a single number (a scalar) and the covariance matrix reduces to the variance (also a scalar). Therefore, only normal multiplication (as opposed to matrix multiplication) is involved."

    "# Section 2: Static one-dimensional example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by considering the first example we discussed in the lecture: determining the position of a stationary car. We'll assume that all we are interested in is a one-dimensional value, such as the distance along a road from a landmark. We are going to try to predict the true position based on some noisy measurements of the distance. Since we going to generate the noisy measurements by hand and we will know the true position, we can see how well our algorithm does. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, when we discussed this example, we focused on the measurement noise. Here we will include the model noise too. That is our model for the position will be **$x$ = constant + noise**. In other words, we have two noise parameters: one for the model and one for the measurement. This will make it easier to connect our static example to the dynamic one, where both types of noise are present. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of two noise parameters——the variances of the model and the measurement noise——are inputs for the algorithm.  We usually don't know what they are, so we have to make reasonable estimates. In this example, we do know the actual variance for the measurements (since we are generating the measurements ourselves, we choose this parameter), so we can see the effect of making a good estimate (or a bad one) for this parameter. Also, we are going to choose the actual position of our car, so we can see how quickly the Kalman filter converges to the true algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to guess initial values for the initial position of the car and the variance in this initial estimate. And of course, we must specific the number of time points (measurements). Again, these are parameters that you are encouraged to modify to see how they affect convergence.\n",

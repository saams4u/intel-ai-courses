    "You can see both moving average techniques have trouble keeping pace with such an aggressive trend. There's significant lag. This gives us a glimpse into why using moving average techniques alone to detect and forecast trend can be problematic. One thing that is clear, however, is that the exponential weighting does a better job following the trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Weights\n",
    "I chose the weights above for explanatory purposes but there are numerous methods to find the optimal weighting scheme. A full discussion is far beyond the scope of this tutorial. Nonetheless, it is helpful that you be acclimated to the formulation and possible initialization strategies.\n",

    "$\\alpha$ is a smoothing constant  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Initialization\n",
    "There are many initialization strategies. A simple one is to set $S_2$ equal to $y_1$. Another strategy is to find the mean of the first couple of observations. Once you've initialized, you simply use the update rule above to calculate all values. \n",

    "Thankfully, you'll never have to actually go through this arduous process. There are great methods in **statsmodels** that will do all this heavy lifting for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Alpha\n",
    "One last comment: choosing the optimal value for $\\alpha$ is also taken care of for you by **statsmodels**. A solver uses a metric like MSE to find an $\\alpha$ that minimizes that metric. Therefore, you rarely have to choose this value yourself, but at least you have a basic idea as to what's happening under the hood."

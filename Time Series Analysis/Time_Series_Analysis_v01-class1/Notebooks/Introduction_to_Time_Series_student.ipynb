    "\n",
    "As you learned in lecture, time series data has three components: \n",
    "1. Trend\n",
    "2. Seasonality\n",
    "3. Residual \n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes time for the rubber meet the road, so to speak. Let's take what we've learned about time series data and apply it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "What will we accomplish?\n",
    "1. First, we'll separately construct each time series component. \n",
    "2. Then we'll bring the three components together to create a simulated time series dataset. \n",
    "3. Finally, we'll leverage time series model decomposition in Python to deconstruct the series. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll complete this process for the two most common processes: additive and multiplicative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of this exercise is to get you familiar with time series data and simple modeling approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should walk away from this tutorial with:\n",
    "1. A practical understanding of the three components of time series data \n",
